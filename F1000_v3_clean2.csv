When bound by agonistic ligands, most notably a-melanocyte stimulating hormone (aMSH)1, MC1R initiates a cascade of UV-protective events mediated by activation of adenylyl cyclase and generation of cAMP that result in melanin production and enhanced genome stability via enhancement of DNA repair2. In addition to aMSH, MC1R signaling is regulated by other soluble ligands, most notably agouti signaling protein (ASIP) which antagonizes MC1R signaling, decreases cAMP levels, and diminishes downstream melanocyte responses such as pigment induction3,4. Recently, it has become clear that ß-defensin 3 (BD3), known for its role in innate antimicrobial immunity, binds and influences MC1R signaling as a neutral MC1R agonist that blunts aMSH-mediated MC1R activation as well as ASIP-mediated MC1R antagonism5–8. Thus, BD3 may be an important regulator of MC1R-dependent melanocyte responses in the skin.Because UV radiation is a major causative agent for melanoma and other skin cancers and because MC1R signaling mediates critical UV-protective responses such as melanization of the skin and melanocytic resistance to UV mutagenesis, it is important to understand how UV affects expression of MC1R ligands in the skin. aMSH levels increase in response to UV exposure of the skin. Cui and coworkers reported that UV promoted transcriptional increases in pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), the protein precursor for aMSH, in a cell damage and p53-dependent manner in epidermal keratinocytes9, supporting the hypothesis that melanocytic MC1R responses are modified by intracutaneous UV-regulated mechanisms. Similarly, recent studies reported that UVB radiation caused an increase BD3 mRNA and protein levels both in vivo and in vitro10, either in a cell-autonomous, damage-dependent manner or in response to inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-1 (IL-1ß) and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNFa) known to promote its induction11,12. In an effort to understand the mechanisms of how BD3 production may be influenced by UV radiation, we determined its expression in freshly isolated human skin explants. Here we report that BD3 expression increases in a UV-independent manner in neonatal human skin explants in response to processing and culturing of tissues ex vivo.","05 Mar 2015","Approved","Zalfa Abdel-Malek, Cancer Institute, University of Cincinnati, OH, USA","Author Response 19 Feb 2015"," I have read the revised article by Horrell and D'Orazio.

By January 14, 2015, a total of 21296 probable and confirmed cases, including 8429 deaths from Ebola virus disease (EVD), had been reported from five countries in West Africa - Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, and Sierra Leone (http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/148237/2/roadmapsitrep_14Jan2015_eng.pdf?ua=1). EVD with a high case-fatality rate of 40% and with currently no approved vaccine or therapy, represents a major public health threat.In response to the current Ebola virus outbreak, the international community has urged for accelerated development of drugs against EVD but also has endorsed the clinical use of unregistered treatments for Ebola1. Conventional time and the money consuming approach of drug development (> 10 years; > 2 billions $) does not meet the current urgent need for anti-Ebola drugs. Repurposing or repositioning of existing drugs could overcome some of these obstacles and help in the rapid discovery and development of therapeutics for EVD, although this approach does not negate the need for some preclinical studies and clinical trials for validation of the proposed indications. Recently, results of two large repurposing screenings of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs have been reported. In the first study, Madrid and co-workers performed in vitro and in vivo (in mice) screening of 1012 FDA-approved drugs and selected 24 candidate entry inhibitors for Ebola virus2. In the second study, 53 inhibitors of Ebola virus infection with IC50 < 10 µM and selectivity index SI > 10-fold have been identified by in vitro screening of 2816 FDA-approved drugs3. In the same study, an additional 95 drugs which are active against Ebola virus infection with IC50 > 10 µM and SI <10-fold were also reported.Although in vitro and in vivo screening for repurposing/repositioning of existing drugs could significantly accelerate discovery of new drugs these approaches are time-consuming and costly for screening of large drug libraries. Recently, we proposed a novel approach for in silico screening of molecular libraries for drug candidates4–8. This approach, which uses the average quasi valence number (AQVN) and the electron-ion interaction potential (EIIP), parameters determining long-range interaction between biological molecules, might hold a key to overcoming some of these obstacles in experimental screening by significantly reducing the number of compounds which should be in vitro and in vivo tested9. Among 3300 currently used molecular descriptors, AQVN and EIIP represent the unique physical properties which characterize the long-range interactions between biological molecules43. Small molecules with similar AQVN and EIIP values interact with the common therapeutic target, which allow establish criterions for virtual screening of molecular libraries for compounds with similar therapeutic properties4–9.Here we develop the EIIP/AQVN-based criterion for virtual screening of molecular libraries for candidate drugs against Ebola virus infection. Using this criterion we screened DrugBank (http://www.drugbank.ca) and selected 267 approved and 382 experimental drugs as candidates for treatment of EVD. Anopen access portal allowing screening of molecular libraries for candidate drugs for treatment of EVD was established.","19 Feb 2015","Approved","Patrick Butaye, School of Veterinary Medicine, Ross University, Saint Kitts and Nevis","Author Response 13 Feb 2015"," The revision is approved I have read this submission.

They easily learn a target when its defining features are perceived by the ventro-frontal area of the eye, but are less accurate when the crucial features of the target appear in the dorso-frontal area (Baumgärtner, 1928; Chittka et al., 1988; Giurfa et al., 1999; Lehrer, 1999; Morawetz & Spaethe, 2012; Wehner, 1972). Interestingly, this behavioural asymmetry is also found in Drosophila melanogaster (Sareen et al., 2011) – a hint that the ventral part of the frontal eye region may play a central role in visual decision making of flying insects.This behavioural asymmetry might in theory be explained by specialization in eye morphology. This is found in the eye of the honeybee drone, where the dorsal area is adapted to queen detection by increasing visual acuity and sensitivity, which is partly achieved by enlarged facet diameters and a reduction of the interommatidial angles (Menzel et al., 1991; Seidl, 1982; Streinzer et al., 2013; van Praagh et al., 1980). However, such regional specialisation in eye optics is not found in the worker honeybee, where the interommatidial angles and facet diameters are similar in the frontal visual field 30° below and above the horizontal plane (Seidl, 1982).It is also possible that regional specialisation of the visual system occurs at the neuronal level. Indeed, ascending neurons of the medulla show differences in arborisation patterns between the ventral and dorsal area (Ehmer & Gronenberg, 2002), indicating that both areas of the visual field are to some extent processed separately. Furthermore, the output of these two areas becomes segregated in the anterior optic tubercle and in the collar of the calyxes of the mushroom bodies (Ehmer & Gronenberg, 2002; Mota et al., 2011). The data hint at differences in neuronal processing between these two eye regions and correspond with the behavioural evidence of a dorso-ventral differentiation (Baumgärtner, 1928; Chittka et al., 1988; Giurfa et al., 1999; Lehrer, 1999; Morawetz & Spaethe, 2012; Wehner, 1972).Nevertheless, there is evidence suggesting that bees may have the ability to improve discrimination performance in the dorso-frontal area of the visual field, for example when differential conditioning is applied (Giurfa et al., 1999). It is therefore possible that the dorso-ventral asymmetry might be explained by attentional mechanisms, which focus the visual processing capacity of the brain flexibly to the currently most important area in the visual field (spatial attention; Carrasco & McElree, 2001; Druker & Anderson, 2010; Geng & Behrmann, 2002; Posner, 1980; Yantis & Jonides, 1984). Attention can be thought of as a kind of ‘inner’ eye, focusing on a spatial subset of the information that is available from the visual sensory periphery. Attention-like processes in the context of feature learning have been considered in honeybees, bumblebees and fruit flies (Avargues-Weber et al., 2010; Avargues-Weber et al., 2015; Dyer & Chittka, 2004; Giurfa, 2004; Giurfa et al., 1999; Morawetz & Spaethe, 2012; Morawetz et al., 2013; Spaethe et al., 2006; Van Swinderen & Greenspan, 2003; Zhang & Srinivasan, 1994). Spatial attention is well described in vertebrates, but has only recently been explored in two insect species, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster (Sareen et al., 2011) and the honeybee Apis mellifera (Paulk et al., 2014).Spatial attention optimizes search processes in detection tasks, where the subject has an expectation of the appearance of the object, using external cueing or own experience (Posner, 1980). Search efforts can then be directed to this region which leads to faster and more accurate decisions (Carrasco & McElree, 2001). Hence, spatial attention would be a useful tool for foraging bees helping to adapt to various spatial settings of flower distribution. The dorso-ventral asymmetry observed in visual discrimination tasks could be explained by attention being focused on the ventral part of the visual field by default, but the attentional focus could be moved to other parts of the visual field, if necessary. To test if bees can overcome their dorso-ventral asymmetry in visual discrimination tasks, we confronted honeybees with three search scenarios differing in the positioning of the target in the visual field. This approach allows to analyse the changes in search performance and flight behaviour over time and therefore to identify possible adaptations of the search behaviour to the particular target presentation.","19 Feb 2015","Approved","Martin Egelhaaf, Department of Biology, Bielefeld University, Germany","Author Response (Member of the F1000 Faculty) 16 Feb 2015"," The revised article answers most of my remarks and questions in a satisfactory way.

Clearly such a line was very close (5 cm) to the targets so that decision counting may have under/over estimated real decisions performed (and perhaps) modified at further distances from the targets. It would be therefore interesting to contrast the decisions counted and established following the authors' method with a different one, which, for instance, may be based on quantifying angular deviations of trajectories along the flight path; one can establish a criterion for a decision based on an angular deviation from the entrance vector and quantify decision which may occur before reaching the decision line defined by the authors.This mirrors the other referees’ concern and we have now added a much more detailed analysis at various distances from the target screen. A minor concern relates to incomplete citations in the paper.

Additionally, the statement on the relative recency of studies on attention in insects is questionable. Although it is not explicitly said - probably because of constraints imposed by reviewers - the work by van Swinderen and Greenspan (2003) constitutes a study on visual attention. Also, if one focuses on bees, the use of this concept of attention dates to 2004 (Giurfa, 2004) when it was argued that discrimination between perceptually closer stimuli was possible after differential conditioning but not after absolute conditioning due to differences in attention inculcated by these two training procedures. The idea was further developed in later papers, so that referring the use of this concept in insects to 2011 seems a bit unfair to prior contributions which also focused on the same idea.We have now added these references as suggested.

This effect is mostly attributed to the intestinally derived hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP)2. These hormones have a very short half-life as they are rapidly inactivated by the ubiquitous enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP4)3. The finding that the incretin effect is impaired in subjects with type 2 diabetes4 led to two major types of GLP-1 based therapies5 - intravenously or sub-cutaneously administered GLP-1 mimetics that are resistant to DPP4 (exenatide, liraglutide, etc.)6, and the orally administered gliptins that prolong the physiological actions of incretin hormones by inhibiting DPP4 (sitagliptin, vildagliptin, etc.)7–9. Due to the multifarious roles played by the DPP4 enzyme10–12, the possible side effects of these drugs (acute pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, etc.13–15) are strongly contested by researchers who argue that current statistics are insufficient16,17 to conclusively attribute these side effects to the otherwise beneficial GLP-1 drugs18. Compound promiscuity is another phenomenon that might play a crucial role in determining the side effects of these therapies, although this aspect has rarely been pursued intensively19.Previous work by our group has established the spatial and electrostatic congruence in cognate residue pairs of the active site in proteins with the same functionality (CLASP)20,21. CLASP analysis indicated that the phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) from Bacillus cereus has spatial and electrostatic congruence with a serine protease motif22. This was validated by protease assays, mass spectrometry and by inhibition of the native phospholipase activity of PI-PLC by the well-known serine protease inhibitor AEBSF (IC50 = 0.018 mM). The specificity of the protease activity was for a proline in the amino terminal, suggesting that PI-PLC is a prolyl peptidase, similar to the DPP4 enzyme. This finding led us to believe that the gliptins would have similar inhibitory effect on PI-PLC. In the current work, we have confirmed the inhibition of the native phospholipase activity of PI-PLC using two gliptins - vildagliptin23 (at µ-molar concentrations) and K57924 (at nano-molar concentrations).Subsequently, we used a motif derived from a DPP4 protein25, in addition to the trypsin motif used previously22, to query a comprehensive and non-redundant (50% sequence identity) list of ~5000 human proteins with known structures using CLASP, intending to identify other proteins that might be inhibited by the gliptins. From the set of proteins with significant congruent matches with these two motifs, we identified a pancreatic lipase26 and a gastric lipase27, keeping the context of lipases, acute pancreatitis and GLP-1 based therapies in mind. Our findings rationalize the elevated levels of serum lipase found in patients undergoing DPP4 inhibitor based therapies28,29, although these reports are in disagreement with other findings30,31. While it is logical and expected to find scaffolds that are congruent to trypsin and DPP4 active sites in lipases based on the current results and our previous findings22, we also show the presence of the serine catalytic triad in close proximity to the active site residues of proteins which have a completely different enzymatic mechanism (for example, in glutaminyl cyclase which is a transferase32). This corroborates the current belief that convergent evolution occurs more frequently than previously believed33. Thus, we propose a rational method to identify proteins that might have unintended and undesirable interactions with newly introduced compounds, and substantiate our claims by demonstrating the inhibition of the native phospholipase activity of PI-PLC from B. cereus using gliptins that are used in type 2 diabetes therapy.","20 Jan 2015","Approved","Mark D Gorrell, Molecular Hepatology, Centenary Institute, Australia","Author Response 29 Jan 2015"," Thank you to the authors for developing this paper.I have some further comments. The primary issue now is the speculation in the title.The title seeks to extrapolate the obtained data on two compounds to suggest that it is applicable to all DPP-IV inhibitors.That is, the speculation of this paper is that the presented data is relevant to an entire drug class. The comments and the title should be restricted to one or two of the compounds that were studied in this paper. Moreover, K-579 is not a diabetes drug. In this context, the title needs changing to avoid ambiguity.I suggest:“The dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor vildagliptin used in type 2 diabetes inhibits a phospholipase C: a case of promiscuous scaffolds in proteins.”or“The dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitors vildagliptin and K-579 inhibit a phospholipase C: a case of promiscuous scaffolds in proteins.” This study complements the much broader work using focused, direct technology for measuring and detecting off-target inhibition. That paper is published in Nature Chemical Biology in 2014 (Bachovchin et al. 2014). That study similarly showed that vildagliptin inhibits enzymes other than DPP-IV. That study showed that DPP4 inhibitors differ, such that sitagliptin does not inhibit other enzymes.The authors need to comment and restrict their conclusions to the compounds that they studied rather than imply that DPP-IV inhibiting compounds that they did not study, such as sitagliptin, have similar characteristics to the compounds that they did study. The data of this study is biochemical yet 16 of the cited references concern the safety of DPP-IV inhibition. The manuscript now carefully does not draw a link to drug safety; the title needs to do the same. As the paper is focused upon DPP-IV structure and function, more papers on this topic could be cited and linked with the data. For example, the author's amendment mentions contacts in DPP-IV at Glu205, Glu206 and Tyr662. The authors could state that Glu205 and Glu206 have been shown to be essential for catalysis by DPP-IV and cite the paper Abbott et al. (1999). I have read this submission.

Biological network models (hereafter referred to as networks) depict the inter-relationships between multiple signaling pathways and how their perturbations may dysregulate biological processes, eventually leading to the disease.In previously published reports, we described the construction of a set of 90 networks that captured a large range of biological processes relevant to non-diseased lung tissue3–7. The generation of this set of networks relied on both manual curation of published literature and a data-driven reverse causal reasoning (RCR) methodology8 to augment the causal biological framework underlying the network architecture (Figure 1). We used the Biological Expression Language (BEL) to represent precise biological relationships in a computable and standardized format8. We have built upon this approach and describe here a unique, three-phase systems biology and crowdsourcing approach to construct a comprehensive set of 50 molecular networks that describe the biological processes relevant to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung biology (Figure 2). COPD is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide and its incidence is increasing among chronic diseases in the USA9,10. COPD is a chronic, progressive inflammatory disease induced by cigarette smoking, inhalation of pollutants, dust, chemicals, or other foreign matter, which ultimately manifests as tissue destruction in the alveolar compartments and airflow limitation, leading to reduced oxygen exchange11–15. COPD affects a wide spectrum of biological processes in lung tissue, such as oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, proliferation, and senescence16,17. Understanding the mechanisms involved in these processes is important in understanding the onset of the disease and in identifying drug targets to develop effective COPD treatments18,19. As recently reported by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), current pharmacologic therapies cannot cure the disease but only reduce the symptoms, and the frequency and severity of exacerbations, i.e., slow down the rate of disease progression11; thus it appears most efficient to target the COPD-specific pathomechanisms at the earliest distinguishable state, when the extent of irreversible damage is still small, and their molecular processes are not yet convoluted with secondary processes and comorbidities, e.g., bacterial and viral infections, as they occur during the exacerbations typical for later stages of COPD. Since smoking cessation/replacement appears to be the most efficient therapy in smoking-related COPD11, the models of early onset COPD can also be expected to be valuable tools for the development and testing of reduced risk products that may prevent COPD progression in a comparable manner as cessation does.Figure 1. Network construction using a systems biology and crowdsourcing approach.Networks were constructed using published literature and data sets, and opened to the public for comment and editing in the Network Verification Challenge. The three phases of COPD network construction are shown. (A and B) Phase 1: COPD augmentation using literature and data. (C and D) Phase 2: Online verification by the public during an “open phase”, and Phase 3: Face-to-face jamboree meeting where scientists and subject matter experts gathered to discuss the networks and make final decisions for the next versions.Figure 2. Fifty networks available during the network verification challenge and their associated biological processes.The networks reported here were created first from a literature scaffold and expanded via data enhancement using RCR (Phase 1), then they were made available online to the entire scientific community for critical review during the Network Verification Challenge (NVC) “Open Phase” (Phase 2) under the umbrella of the systems biology verification (sbv) IMPROVER project20 (Figure 1). Finally, a prioritized subset of 15 of these networks was discussed during an in-person jamboree meeting where the crowd-submitted revisions were reviewed and decisions to improve the networks were finalized (Phase 3). The final versions of the networks are available at https://bionet.sbvimprover.com for the public to view, and for registered users in the NVC to continue to discuss.A variety of COPD networks have been created by various research groups, including networks focused on muscle to study skeletal muscle abnormalities21, networks to compare COPD and asthma22, and a knowledge management framework to integrate COPD clinical and experimental data23. To our knowledge, this is the first set of crowd-verified networks available to the broader scientific community as a unified collection on a freely accessible web-based platform. Ultimately, this interface will allow for continuous input and improvement in the networks, leading to better understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of COPD.","02 Mar 2015","Approved","Patrick Ruch, BiTeM group, Library and Information Sciences, University of Applied Sciences—HEG, Switzerland","Author Response 20 May 2015"," I would welcome more information about the original networks, which were generated out of text/data mining.

CrT loss of function is mostly caused by missense mutations and small deletions which are concentrated in the transmembrane domains 7 and 8 of the protein (van de Kamp et al., 2014). In physiological conditions, about half of our normal Cr requirement is satisfied by the diet. De novo endogenous synthesis of Cr takes place mainly in the kidney, liver and pancreas and involves the enzymes l-arginine: glycineamidinotransferase (AGAT) and S-adenosyl-l-methionine:N-guanidinoacetatemethyltransferase (GAMT) (Wyss & Kaddurah-Daouk, 2000). Cr is a polar hydrophilic molecule unable to cross the lipidic membranes, which uses a Na+- and Cl-- dependent plasma membrane CrT to enter the cells (Nash et al., 1994). CrT is widely expressed in the brain tissue with a prominent presence in the cortical and subcortical regions involved in motor and sensory processing, learning and memory, and regulation of emotion-related behavior (Lowe et al., 2014; Mak et al., 2009).Patients affected by cerebral creatine deficiency syndrome-1 (CCDS1) share depletion of brain Cr and the clinical phenotype with patients carrying the other two defects of Cr metabolism which involve mutations of genes encoding the biosynthesizing enzymes AGAT and GAMT (Item et al., 2001; Stockler et al., 1994). Replenishment of the brain Cr pool is the only effective therapy for Cr deficiency diseases (Battini et al., 2002; Schulze et al., 2001; Stockler et al., 1996). Unfortunately, in CCDS1 patients even very high doses of Cr, alone or combined with the Cr precursors arginine and glycine to stimulate endogenous Cr synthesis, fail to restore the Cr content in brain (Chilosi et al., 2008; Valayannopoulos et al., 2012). There have been attempts to normalize the levels of Cr in the brain with Cr-lipophilic analogs, but these compounds have proven ineffective when administered to patients (Fons et al., 2010). Thus, CCDS1 is still missing an effective treatment.Preclinical animal models are crucial tools to dissect disease pathogenic mechanisms and develop new therapeutic strategies. Only two murine models of CCDS1 are available so far, and they have only been analyzed at the behavioral and neurochemical level. An ubiquitous CrT knockout mouse model has been generated by deletion of 2–4 exons in the Slc6a8 gene. Learning and memory deficits, impaired motor activity and Cr depletion in brain and muscles have been reported in animals at three-four months of age (Skelton et al., 2011). Another murine model is based on the use of the CaMKII promoter to drive Cre-recombinase expression, achieving a CrT deletion only in postnatal forebrain excitatory neurons. This strategy was successful in avoiding the peripheral Cr depletion and the motor deficits shown by germline CrT knockout mouse. Behavioral analysis in mice at 12 months of age revealed learning and memory impairments that could be ameliorated by supplementation of cyclocreatine, a Cr analog (Kurosawa et al., 2012).For translational studies, the phenotype variations observed in different mouse models, carrying similar mutations and the effects of genetic backgrounds highlight the importance of validating phenotypes and therapeutic efficacy in multiple models and in different laboratories (Katz et al., 2012). Such validation will hopefully increase the relevance of preclinical studies to the human disease. To increase the number of CCDS1 models, we generated a novel murine model of CCDS1 obtained by ubiquitous deletion of 5–7 exons in the Slc6a8 gene. These mice presented a remarkable Cr depletion in the brain tissue and displayed cognitive defects resembling the key features of human CCDS1, and providing a new promising CCDS1 animal model.","04 Feb 2015","Approved","Luis M.

Significant variability in sedation practices exist nationwide in the United States3, and efforts have been made to investigate systematic approaches to sedation management in order to improve patient outcomes4. As the adverse effects of over-sedation and prolonged sedation have become more apparent (e.g. longer duration of mechanical ventilation, longer ICU length of stay, increased mortality)5–7, the paradigm has shifted towards a “more is less” strategy8. Keeping critically ill patients less sedated and more interactive is supported by recent clinical practice guidelines on pain, agitation, and delirium9. However, severe agitation is common in critically ill patients and may have many underlying causes; agitation in such patients is associated with prolonged ventilator and ICU days as well as higher rates of self-extubation10. It is therefore important to determine the optimum level of sedation for every individual critically ill patient. Patients requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy typically require sedation during the acute phase of their illness or when they are agitated such that they are at risk for self-harm, such as displacement of ECMO tubing. However, patients receiving ECMO support are challenging to sedate, often require escalating doses of sedatives and opioids to maintain an appropriate, safe level of sedation11. The challenges often relate to the dynamic alterations in pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of commonly used sedatives and opioids in the setting of ECMO. Hemodilution, protein binding changes, changes in blood flow especially through the lungs, sequestration of medications by the ECMO circuit, binding of drugs to the oxygenator membrane, and organ function changes may impact the clinical effects of sedative and analgesic medications in this patient population10–19.Ketamine is potentially a promising complementary sedative agent in the setting of ECMO in that it has hypnotic, analgesic, and amnesic properties owing to its activity at a variety of receptors. Ketamine is an antagonist of glutamate receptors as well as N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and it has activity at all opioid receptors, though with different affinities and activities at those receptors. Ketamine also antagonizes nicotinic acetylcholine receptors noncompetitively and profoundly inhibits muscarinic receptors in addition to inhibiting L-type calcium channels20. Ketamine’s lack of respiratory depression, bronchodilating properties, in addition to generally being well tolerated hemodynamically (despite some myocardial depressant properties) theoretically make it an attractive choice for sedation and analgesia21. Recent clinical practice guidelines on pain, agitation, and delirium9 mention the use of ketamine as a possible adjunct for non-neuropathic pain management and suggest that nonbenzodiazepine sedatives such as propofol and dexmedetomidine may be preferred over benzodiazepine sedation. They do not provide recommendations for ketamine use as a continuous infusion. To our knowledge, no studies have compared clinical outcomes in ICU patients sedated with ketamine infusion to other agents. Ketamine may provide an alternative or adjunct option in difficult to sedate patients. As critical drug shortages continue to impact the selection of available drugs (e.g. propofol shortage22), it is important to review all relevant agents available for clinical use. The purpose of this study was to describe the use of ketamine infusion for patients receiving concurrent sedation/analgesia on ECMO support. The specific aims were to determine whether ketamine altered Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) scores or decreased concurrent sedative, opioid, or vasopressor requirements.","05 Mar 2015","Approved","Anthony Absalom, Department of Anaesthesiology, University Medical Center Groningen, Netherlands",NA," Summary:The authors should be congratulated on an excellent article reporting an analysis of routinely collected clinical data.

The discussion is informative and educational. The study limitations are appropriately recognised and discussed, and suggestions for future investigation are made. The conclusions are well supported by the data. Abstract Clear and concise.

The proposed hypothesis is clinically very relevant and plausible. The specific aims of the study are stated clearly.MethodsThe description of the methods is completely clear. Appropriate methodology was applied. To assess the influence of ketamine on sedative and vasopressor requirements, the authors arbitrarily chose, by consensus, definitions of “ clinically meaningful minimal changes in medication after the start of ketamine infusion”.  This is a reasonable approach. The statistical analysis is clearly described and is appropriate. ResultsWe have two comments about the presentation of the results. The first is that table 2 is somewhat confusing. It is not clear what the “maximum” and “minimum” infusion rates refer to. We suggest that the authors clearly state the time period over which these maximum and minimum infusion rates were determined. If these rates are not the rates after starting ketamine, then we suggest that the authors present the median (IQR, range) infusion rates during some (arbitrary) time period after starting ketamine.Our second comment about the results concerns the consistency of units used in presentation of sedative and vasopressor infusion rates. In the methods the authors state arbitrarily chosen definitions of clinically meaningful changes in medication. These thresholds are defined in mcg/kg/min units for each of the drugs. In the text and in table 2 of the results, the infusion rates of fentanyl and midazolam are reported in different units (mcg/min). Thereafter the authors only report the numbers of patients in which there was a clinically relevant change.  To more easily give the reader an idea of the magnitude of the relative changes in infusion rate of fentanyl and midazolam, we suggest that for these drugs the before and ketamine infusion rates are also presented in mcg/kg/min.DiscussionDiscussion is very well written and informative. The study limitations are well recognised. The conclusions are supported by the data.ReferencesAppropriate use of references We have read this submission.

One important aspect of learning-related improvements in cognitive functions is working memory, which is the ability of simultaneously store and process information held in mind despite irrelevant, potentially interfering stimuli1. It is generally accepted that working memory processes support higher cognitive functions including reasoning1.Several studies have assessed working memory capacity during childhood and around the age of school entry, at a time when the learning load is large. For example, Alloway et al. showed that working memory impairment seems to be disadvantageous for learning abilities in reading and mathematics2. In addition, using the Conners’ Teacher Rating Scale, school teachers have reported high inattentiveness and executive problems in those children with poor working memory2.Regarding the predictive power of working memory for learning processes, it is not surprising that difficulties in cognitive functions such as reading3 and mathematics4 are associated with working memory skills. For example, Wang et al. showed that children between 8 and 10 years with difficulties in single word reading performed worse in simple and complex span tasks compared to controls, two widely used working memory tasks3. In another study, mathematical learning disabilities of school-age children were shown to be associated with low performance in spatial working memory4.Considering the impact of working memory on a wide range of cognitive functions, the enhancement of working memory is of great interest. Studies in adults showed that working memory may be trained in elderly people of around 80 years5 as well as in young adults in their twenties6. Also in pre-school children, visuospatial working memory training improved untrained verbal working memory performance7. Some of these studies not only showed significant performance increases in the trained working memory tasks, but also in other, untrained working memory tasks5 and functionally more distant tasks such as fluid intelligence tests (transfer effect)6.In a more recent study involving school-age children of around 9 years, Jaeggi et al. also investigated the long-term effects of working memory training8. Immediately after the training, they observed significant higher fluid intelligence in the group with a large training gain compared to the small gain group or a control group. Thus, the larger the training improvement, the greater were the transfer effects. Interestingly, the gain in fluid intelligence remained stable after three months without additional training in the large training gain group8.The aim of our study was to investigate working memory training and its effects on working memory tasks and fluid intelligence in male subjects between 10 and 16 years. In fact, this age range may be particular susceptible to interventions because many cognitive functions are still developing9. Furthermore, working memory performance has been shown to be linked to attentional control10 and processing speed11. Thus, putative transfer effects on fluid intelligence may not be limited to fluid intelligence, but may also include other cognitive functions. Hence, in addition to working memory and fluid intelligence tasks, we also measured inhibition and interference tasks as well as standardized processing speed. Finally, long-term effects may be indicative for the effectiveness of the training, thus, cognitive testing was repeated not only immediately after the training period but also a few months later.","19 Dec 2014","Approved","Silvia Bunge, Department of Psychology, University of California Berkeley, USA","Author Response 02 Jan 2015"," The authors report their results clearly, and articulate the limitations of their study.

The gene is located on chromosome 8p21 in a region frequently deleted in early prostate cancers (reviewed in1,2). Studies in Nkx3.1 knockout mice have provided compelling evidence that Nkx3.1 is a prostate tumor suppressor3–5. These mice develop prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), a precancerous lesion characterized by hyperproliferation of dysplastic cells, indicating that Nkx3.1 is haploinsufficient for PIN suppression6. Additional studies showed that serial passage of PIN-like lesions from Nkx3.1 mutant mice can undergo progressively severe histopathological alterations5. Finally, loss of Nkx3.1 can cooperate with loss of Pten and p27 in prostate cancer development in mice7,8, while Nkx3.1 overexpression inhibits cell proliferation in Pten null epithelial grafts9. These data indicate that the diminished expression of NKX3.1 that is frequently observed in human prostate cancers10 is involved in the initial stage of prostate carcinogenesis. While the tumor suppressor function of NKX3.1 remains poorly defined at the molecular level, the knockout phenotypes suggested that Nkx3.1 controls genes involved in prostate development, differentiation, and maintenance of tissue integrity.Like other NKX class homeoproteins, NKX3.1 can function as a transcriptional repressor by binding a non-canonical homeodomain DNA motif such as naturally occurring in the mouse androgen receptor promoter9 or artificially presented in synthetic reporter genes11. Transcriptional repression may involve NKX3.1-mediated recruitment of co-repressors12 and the histone deacetylase, HDAC19. A second mode of trans-repression found for the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) gene occurs independently of NKX3.1 promoter binding sites, but through repressive interaction with transcriptional activators such as SP113 and prostate-derived ETS factor (PDEF14). NKX3.1 was also shown to activate gene transcription, either through direct promoter binding as in the case of PCAN1 and HK215,16 or through interaction with other transcriptional activators such as serum response factor (SRF) or FoxA1 and the androgen receptor (AR)17,18.Transcriptomic profiling combined with global mapping of > 9,500 genomic binding sites by ChIP-sequencing revealed a set of 282 putative direct target genes that were differentially expressed in young NKX3.1-/- prostates not displaying PIN16,19. A subset of NKX3.1 target genes was also regulated by Myc with both transcription factors showing mutual antagonism16. Since overexpression of Myc cooperates with loss of Nkx3.1 in mouse prostate tumorigenesis, maintaining proper control of the common Nkx3.1/Myc target genes may be involved in Nkx3.1’s tumor suppressor function16. A similar study in aged mice already displaying PIN revealed a gene expression signature indicative of impaired response to oxidative stress20. Interestingly, these changes correlated with a 5-fold increase in oxidative DNA damage in Nkx3.1-/- prostates. Whether oxidative DNA damage is a direct consequence of loss of NKX3.1 or a secondary consequence of PIN development is unknown.Another key to understanding the tumor suppressor function of NKX3.1 potentially lies with its protein interaction partners. Several have been described that modulate NKX3.1’s transcriptional effects (e.g. SRF17,21, PDEF14, HDAC19, SP113, MYC16, and AR18). In addition, NKX3.1 was shown to bind to and augment the activity of topoisomerase I, suggesting that it functions in DNA repair22,23. NKX3.1 localizes to sites of DNA damage, promotes ATM and ATR activity, and enhances the survival of cells exposed to DNA damage24. Loss of NKX3.1 function in premalignant prostate cells may therefore accelerate the acquisition of DNA damage, potentially aggravated by unabated accumulation of reactive oxygen species thus promoting cellular transformation24. Nevertheless, it is currently unclear whether the function of NKX3.1 in DNA repair is indirectly mediated through transcriptional effects or directly through physical interactions with the DNA repair machinery.In this report, we present an analysis of the NKX3.1 protein interactome that revealed intimate physical links of NKX3.1 with the DNA repair machinery, namely components of the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) holocomplex (XRCC5/Ku80, XRCC6/Ku70) and poly(ADP) ribose polymerase (PARP1). In addition, transcriptomic profiling of immortalized prostate epithelial cells upon acute activation of NKX3.1 revealed a rapid and complex transcriptional response that is a near mirror image of the gene expression signature of human PIN devoid of NKX3.1. Taken together, these data shed new light onto the elusive tumor suppressor activity of NKX3.1, directly implicating this homeoprotein in DNA repair and in driving a gene expression signature indicative of an essential function in maintaining the differentiation state of luminal prostate epithelial cells.","26 Jun 2014","Approved","Philip D.

Several models have been presented in the context of morphological, molecular, and genetic developmental patterns. The most widely discussed model is the “developmental hourglass”, which places the strongest conservation across species in the “phylotypic stage”. The first observations supporting the hourglass model go back to von Baer when he noticed that there exists a mid-developmental stage in which embryos of different animals look similar4. On the other hand, the “developmental funnel” model of conservation predicts increasing diversification as development progresses5,6.Recently, the hourglass model has come under new light. Multiple studies have observed the hourglass pattern across diverse biological processes, including transcriptome divergence7–12, transcriptome age7,13,14, molecular interaction15, and evolutionary selective constraints10,15,16. Despite these observations the genomic basis and even the existence of the developmental hourglass effect have been the subject of an intense debate1,6,14,17–22. More importantly, the underlying mechanism that can shape the developmental process in the hourglass or funnel forms is still unknown.We aim to understand the conditions under which the hourglass effect can emerge in a general setting, based on an abstract model for the evolution of embryonic development. The model focuses on a hierarchical network that represents the temporal “execution” of the underlying Gene Regulatory Network (GRN) during development. Each layer of the network corresponds to a developmental stage. The nodes at each layer represent regulatory genes (i.e., genes encoding transcription factors or signaling molecules) that undergo significant activity change at that corresponding stage. The edges from genes at one layer to genes at the next layer represent regulatory interactions that cause those activity changes. We refer to this hierarchical network as Developmental Gene Execution Network (DGEN) to distinguish it from the corresponding GRN. A DGEN is subject to evolutionary perturbations (e.g., gene deletions, rewiring, duplication) that may be lethal, or that may impede development, for the corresponding organism.The model predicts that the evolutionary process shapes the DGENs of a population in the form of an hourglass, under fairly general assumptions. Specifically, the number of genes at each developmental stage follows an hourglass pattern, with the smallest number at the “waist” of the hourglass. The main condition for the appearance of the hourglass pattern is that the DGEN should gradually get sparser as development progresses, with general-purpose regulatory genes at the earlier developmental stages and highly specialized regulatory genes at the later stages. This assumption is motivated from the well established patterns of increasing modularity as the embryo develops23. Under the previous condition, the model predicts that gene regulatory changes or rewiring in mid-development are more likely to cause cascades of removing non-essential genes from the DGEN, compared to early or late developmental stages. Another model prediction is that the evolutionary age of DGEN genes also follows an hourglass pattern, with the oldest genes concentrated at the waist.We have examined the aforementioned predictions using transcriptome data from the development of Drosophila melanogaster and Arabidopsis thaliana. This data is insufficient to reconstruct the complete DGEN of these species but it allows to estimate the number of genes at each developmental stage, given an activity variation threshold. Under a wide range of this threshold, the inferred DGEN shape follows an hourglass pattern, the waist of that hourglass roughly coincides with the previously reported phylotypic stage for these species, and the age of the corresponding genes follows the predicted hourglass pattern.Developmental gene execution networksAs a first-order approximation, a regulatory gene can be modeled in one of several discrete functional states24. In the simplest case, a regulatory gene can act as a binary switch (“on” and “off”) but in general a gene may have more than two functional states. The transition of a regulatory gene X from one functional state to another is often (but not always) caused by one or more upstream regulators of X that go through a functional state transition before X. We use the term transitioning gene to refer to a regulatory gene that goes through a functional state transition at a given developmental time anywhere at the developing embryo.A DGEN is a directed and acyclic network; see Figure 1a for an abstract example. The vertical direction refers to developmental time, from the zygote at the top to the developed organism at the bottom. In the horizontal direction we can represent different spatial domains, even though this is not necessary and it is not done in our model. For instance, the zygote at the top of the DGEN would be a single domain, while the organism at the bottom of the DGEN would have the largest number of spatial domains.Development is often approximated (conceptually and experimentally) as a succession of discrete developmental stages. The duration of a developmental stage can be thought of as the typical time that is required for a gene’s functional state transition, and it does not need to be the same for all stages. Each layer of a DGEN refers to a developmental stage, and it includes only the transitioning genes during that stage anywhere in the embryo. The same gene can appear in more than one stage if it goes through several functional state transitions during development. Additionally, a DGEN edge from a gene X at stage l to a gene Y at stage l + 1 implies that the functional transition of X caused the functional transition of Y at the next stage. If gene Y has more than one incoming edge, its functional state transition was caused by the coupled effect of more than one transitioning genes at the earlier stage. Any upstream regulators of Y that remained at the same functional state at stage l are not included in that stage of the DGEN.The sequence of developmental stages is denoted by l = 1 . . . L. The set of transitioning genes at stage l is G(l). A gene g at stage l<L regulates a set of downstream genes at stage l+1 denoted by D(g) (outgoing edges from g). Similarly, a gene g at stage l>1 is regulated by a set of upstream genes U(g) at stage l-1 (incoming edges to g). The functional transitions at the first stage are assumed to be caused by regulatory maternal genes that initiate the developmental process.Model descriptionThe model captures certain aspects of both the developmental process, in the form of a given DGEN for each embryo, and of the evolutionary process, as random perturbations in the structure of individual DGENs in a population. The model does not need to capture the actual functional state transitions or the regulatory input function of each gene. It does capture however the dynamic and stochastic effect of structural network perturbations (gene deletion, rewiring and duplication) on the success of the developmental process, as explained in the following.Similar to the Wright-Fisher model25, we consider a population of N individuals, each represented by a DGEN. In each generation, individuals reproduce asexually, inheriting the DGEN of their parent. Various evolutionary events can cause structural changes in the DGEN of an individual that may result in “developmental failure”. Such individuals (and their DGENs) are replaced with developmentally successful individuals so that the population size remains constant.The model is meant to be as general as possible and so the regulatory interactions between genes of successive stages are determined probabilistically, as follows. Each stage l is assigned a regulatory specificity, or simply specificity s(l) with 0 = s(l) = 1. A gene g at stage l acts as upstream regulator for a gene g' at stage l + 1 with probability s'(l) = 1 - s(l). So, the specificity of a developmental stage determines how likely it is for regulatory genes of that stage to cause a state transition of the genes at the next stage; a higher specificity decreases that likelihood.Our major assumption is that the regulatory specificity increases substantially as development progresses. In other words, the DGEN becomes gradually sparser along the developmental time axis, with s(1) << s(L). This assumption is plausible for the following reasons. First, as development progresses the embryo grows in size forming distinct spatial domains. So, extracellular gene regulation becomes more difficult, especially across different domains. Additionally, as development progresses the transitioning genes become more organ- or tissue-specific, implying that their downstream interactions become sparser. Unfortunately, a direct and empirical investigation of the increasing specificity assumption requires knowledge of the complete DGEN for a given species; this is currently not feasible for even the most well-studied model organisms. However, this assumption is plausible if we consider the well established patterns of increasing modularity as the embryo develops at the morphological, signaling, and genomic levels23.The DGEN structural changes we consider are gene deletions, gene duplications, and gene rewiring:Deletions (DL): This event removes a gene from the DGEN, including its incoming and outgoing edges. There are many genetic mechanisms that may cause such events. A DL event deletes each gene of an individual and at each generation with probability PDL.Duplication (DP): This event creates an identical copy of a gene g with the same downstream and upstream regulators and at the same developmental stage as g. The two genes may have different fates if one of them is subject later to deletion or rewiring. Otherwise, the two genes are considered identical. A DP event duplicates each gene of an individual and at each generation with probability PDP.Rewiring (RW): This event changes the upstream and/or downstream regulators of a gene. Changes in the upstream versus downstream regulators may have different biological basis. The former occur, for instance, as a result of mutations in the transcription factor binding sites in a gene’s promoter or mutations in distal regulatory elements such as enhancers, while the latter may be mostly caused by coding sequence mutations. The details of the rewiring process do not affect the results qualitatively as long as the average density of edges in each stage remains consistent with the specificity of that stage. The specific rewiring mechanisms we use are presented next.Suppose that a RW event affects gene g at stage l. The upstream regulators of g are recomputed based on the specificity of the previous stage, i.e., by choosing each distinct gene of stage l -1 with probability s'(l -1). For the downstream regulators of g, we randomly remove N– existing outgoing edges of g, and then add N+ outgoing edges to randomly chosen genes of stage l + 1 that g is not already connected to. If B(N, p) denotes a Binomial random variable with N trials and success probability p, the random variables N- and N+ are independent and they both follow the B(|D(g)|, s'(l)) distribution (|X| denotes the cardinality of set X). Thus, the number of downstream edges of gene g after a Rewiring event becomes:              |Dnew(g)| = |D(g)| - N–+ N+,which is at least 0 and at most 2 × |D(g)|. This captures that the downstream regulators of g are derived by incremental changes in D(g), instead of giving g a completely new network configuration (thereby, new regulatory function). The higher the regulatory specificity of a stage, the less likely these incremental changes are. An RW event rewires each gene of an individual and at each generation with probability PRW.A gene deletion or rewiring event at stage l can remove an upstream regulator from genes at stage l + 1. A loss of incoming edges may trigger the regulatory failure of a gene, as described next.Regulatory failures (RF): A gene g may not be able to change functional state if some of its upstream regulators U(g) are lost due to DL or RW events (see Figure 1b). Even though regulatory networks are often robust to structural perturbations, even a partial gene loss in U(g) may disable g causing a regulatory failure. It is plausible that the probability of a regulatory failure increases with the fraction of lost upstream regulators. So, if U'(g) is the new set of upstream regulators and |U(g)| > |U'(g)| > 0, gene g is removed with probability:PRF(r)=1-e-zr1-r,<U+2009><U+2009>0<r=1-|U'(g)||U(g)|<1Figure 1. An abstract DGEN.(A) The circles denote state-transitioning genes, edges represent directed regulatory interactions, and colored boxes refer to spatial domains that form during development. If regulatory genes become increasingly function-specific as development progresses, the network gradually becomes sparser in that direction. (B) Evolutionary perturbations on a DGEN’s structure: Gene A is deleted (DL), while gene B is rewired (RW) losing an outgoing edge. This RW event causes the regulatory failure (RF) of gene C, which then causes a cascade of five more RF events. This cascade causes developmental failure (DF). Note that the removal of some upstream regulators does not always cause an RF event (e.g., genes regulated by A).while if |U'(g)| = 0 we set PRF (1) = 1. z is the RF parameter and it depends on the robustness of regulatory interactions to gene loss (see Figure 2).Figure 2. Probability of Regulatory Failure (RF) for three values of the parameter z.r is the fraction of upstream regulating edges that are lost due to a DL or RW event.When a DL or RW event causes one or more RF events, the latter can trigger additional RF events in subsequent developmental stages, leading to cascades of regulatory failures. Such RF cascades may cause developmental failure, meaning that the developed embryo is unable to survive or reproduce.Developmental failure (DF): The last stage of a DGEN represents the fully developed embryo. If that stage includes G transitioning genes at a successfully developed embryo, the simplest assumption is that an individual with less than G genes at stage-L has failed to develop properly. Such DGENs are removed from the population and they are replaced with randomly chosen but successfully developed DGENs. We have also experimented with two variations of the DF event: first, the individual is removed if its last stage has less than G - <U+03B3> genes, where <U+03B3> is small relative to G, and second, the probability of a DF event increases as the number of genes at stage-L decreases below G. The qualitative results, as described next, do not change with these two model variations.","14 Jan 2015","Approved","Marcel Quint, Department of Molecular Signal Processing, Leibniz Institute of Plant Biochemistry, Germany","Author Response 18 Dec 2014"," We highly appreciate that the authors carefully addressed all our concerns and we now have no further reservations. We also add a detailed response to the rebuttal letter: Point#1 of our summarized comments to the first version of the manuscript: “The authors do cite Raff in the first sentence of their introduction, but should state more clearly in which manner their model was inspired by Raff's hypothesis.”Authors' response: The reviewers are right to highlight the connection between our “increasing regulatory specificity” assumption and Raff’s hypothesis. We have included a paragraph in the Discussion section to put Raff’s hypothesis in the context of this work.A first remark is that our assumption is consistent with Raff’s basic premise that modularity increases as the embryo develops. Second, Raff’s hypothesis (see chapter-6 of [1], and in particular Figures 6.6 and 6.7) also states that the “level of interaction” or the “interconnectivity between (body) elements” is maximized at the phylotypic stage. This may be viewed initially as a contradiction between Raff’s hypothesis and our increasing specificity assumption, which states that the density of regulatory interactions is maximized at the earliest stages of development. Note however that Raff’s hypothesis was not stated in terms of gene regulatory interactions -- he was referring more generally to “developmental flexibility”, arguing that early development is flexible because it governs robust and general global patterning processes, late development is also flexible because “signaling events within the primordia are little influenced by events in other primordia”, while mid-development (phylotypic stage)  is least flexible because of the “high interconnectivity between elements that will later come to represent separate modules.” If we think of “developmental flexibility” as the ability of an embryo to survive gene mutations and rewiring at different stages of the developmental process, Raff’s hypothesis is actually consistent with our results regarding the “lethality probability” at each developmental stage (see Figs 6-B, 7-B amd 8-B). The lethality probability is maximized at the phylotypic stage, and it is significantly lower at early and late developmental stages, following the same pattern with Raff’s “developmental flexibility”. Our comment to authors' response: We appreciate that the authors now differentiate between Raff’s hypothesis concerning the modularization (interconnectivity) between body elements (modules) and their ""increasing regulatory specificity“ assumption. We agree that Raff’s hypothesis is consistent with the ""lethality probability“ proposed by the authors in terms of the observed pattern of maximal interconnectivity and maximal probability of lethal effects during the phylotypic stage (mid embryogenesis). However, we would like to point out that a causal relationship between the observed patterns remains to be tested. Point#2 of our summarized comments to the first version of the manuscript: “Correlate and reference major assumptions of the DGEN model that seem plausible with findings from experimental studies that validate this plausibility.”Authors' response to Point #2:  First, to the extent of our knowledge there is no prior work that directly validates the assumption of increasing regulatory specificity as formulated in our paper (i.e., with the specificity of a developmental stage defined as the topological density of regulatory edges in that stage). We are planning to examine the validity of this assumption in the future using various approaches:First we plan to analyze the aforementioned developmental GRNs for the sea-urchin that have been directly examined by Dr. Davidson’s lab at Caltech.Second, we are in the process of examining other genomic metrics, which can be viewed as “proxies” to regulatory specificity. For example, we have defined new measures to quantify how specific a gene’s expression profile in a developmental stage is compared to other developmental stages, which we have tentatively named as “developmental stage specificity index (DSI)”.  Similarly, we defined “tissue specificity index (TSI)”, measuring the bias of a gene’s expression in a specific tissue compared to many other tissues. Analyses of these measures using genomic data from Drosophila so far have revealed generally increasing trends, which are consistent with the idea of increasing specificity. However we are still working on generalizing these analytical tools to data sets generated by different methods and from different species.  Importantly, our model focuses DGENs underlying development, and genomic data can obscure the true signals from genes constituting DGENs.  Thus we are also working on examining these specificity measures using inferred DGENs.  Additionally, we are developing other methods to approximate functional specificity. We hope to complete these analyses as a follow-up paper. The current paper provides theoretical motivation.Third, as the reviewers also point out, there is a large body of prior work in developmental biology that confirms the increasing modularity in the developing embryo (for instance, see Wagner et al., 2007) as well as the increasing specificity of the developmental process at the signaling or genomic level. The connections between this pattern of increasing modularity and the structure of the underlying gene regulatory networks are still not well understood however. We think that it would be misleading if we had argued that these modularity patterns provide a direct validation for our “increasing regulatory specificity” assumption. Please note that we have cited the paper by Wagner et al. at the Introduction and Model Description sections, providing some connections between this work and earlier work on the role of modularity in developmental biology. Our comment to authors' response: The authors point out that ""the connections between this pattern of increasing modularity and the structure of the underlying gene regulatory network are still not well understood“. This statement is valid for experimental studies that aim to address this presumptive causal relationship in a systematic manner and we appreciate that the authors share their future plans to introduce sufficient measures (DSI and TSI) to better understand the nature of this relationship. Point#3 of our summarized comments to the first version of the manuscript: “Correlate the output of the DGEN simulation with existing findings of studies addressing similar questions of the causality of the developmental hourglass phenomenon and discuss potential simplifications of the model assumptions that do not fit experimental results or that are not derivable via experiments yet.”Authors' response to Point #3: This is a very interesting idea and we thank the reviewers for this suggestion. We are planning to pursue this investigation in a follow-up paper that will also include the previously mentioned analysis of sea-urchin GRNs as well as the DSI/TSI results. We believe that it would be distracting to try to include all these results in this first paper, given that the main focus of this work has been on the computational model and the computational results. We are also open to collaborate in this investigation with the reviewers or other researchers working in this area, if they are interested. Our comment to authors' response:  We are delighted to hear that the authors address this question in a follow up paper. We gladly offer our expertise to collaboratively investigate the evolutionary process on the regulatory level that might have led to a correlation between the maximized evolutionary age of expressed genes during mid-embryogenesis and the interconnectivity of (body) modules that are hypothesized to cause the morphological patterns during the phylotypic stage. Points#4 and 5 of our summarized comments to the first version of the manuscript: Include a clear statement how the exact values of the stage specificity (regulatory specificity) s(l) have been derived.  State more clearly that s(l) is the crucial parameter determining the observed phenomena.”Authors' response to Points #4 and 5: The regulatory specificity functions we experimented with are arguably the simplest one could think of. Specifically, we start (Model-1) with the simplest hypothesis that the regulatory specificity does not vary across developmental stages (in the paper we show results for s=0.5 but we have generated results for all values 0.1, 0.2, ... 0.9 and the conclusion remains that when the specificity is constant the network does not evolve into an hourglass shape). Then, we consider (Model-2) a linearly increasing specificity function. We do not argue that this is realistic or that there are experimental results that suggest this linearity or even the increasing trend. It is just the simplest and most parsimonious model that leads to the emergence of an hourglass pattern. Finally, in Figures-9 and 10 we consider a more general specificity function that increases in a non-linear manner, providing a simple way to control the stage at which it gives the mid-range value 0.5. This allows us to examine how the shape of the specificity function s(l) affects the location of the hourglass waist. We hope that follow-up work will reveal experimentally the actual shape of the regulatory specificity function s(l) and there is no doubt that it will not be identical to any of these simple mathematical functions.Please note that we have revised the paragraphs about “Model-1” and “Model-2” in the Simulation section to clarify these points. Our comment to authors' response: We thank the authors for clarifying the paragraphs about ""Model-1“ and ""Model-2“. Specific reviewer comment on the first version of the manuscript “For the probabilities P_{DL} and P_{DP} the explicit formula to compute the corresponding probabilities could also be included within the paragraph analogous to P_{RF}. This would enable a clearer reproducibility.“Authors' response: Actually there is no formula for the gene deletion and duplication probabilities. They are given probability values that do not depend on any other parameters. At each round of the simulation, a gene is duplicated with probability P_{DP}. If not rewired or duplicated, the gene is deleted with probability P_{DL}.  Our comment to authors' response: We thank the authors for clarifying this point for us. Point#7 of our summarized comments to the first version of the manuscript: “Explain why merging OrthoDB results with OrthoMCL results might be plausible and why comparing it with results obtained from phylostratigraphy is reliable.”Authors' response to Point#7: The phylostratigraphy technique as employed by Domazet-Loso et al. and Quint et al. involves the assignment of an evolutionary age to each gene in a given species, by tracing the most distant ancestral node containing at least one immediate daughter species with a detectable homologue. A phylogenetic tree of divergent species ranging from cellular organisms transitioning into simple and more complex eukaryota served as a reference to divide phyla radiating from consecutive ancestral points into distinct phylostratum layers. To determine the homologues, BLAST sequence similarity searches were done against complete genomes reliably annotated across the different phylostrata. Similarly, we obtained known homologues of each Drosophila gene from OrthoDB5 and OrthoMCL5 (that also use BLAST based searches) in the species depicted in Figure 4, and mapped them to six different “phylostrata” (marked in Figure 4). Akin to the method described in the above references, we assigned each gene to a specific “phylostratum” based on the farthest detectable homologue of that gene, and this is referred to as “age index” in the paper. This made it possible to compare the age index based results we obtain in Drosophila to the phylostratigraphy based assignments in Arabidopsis.Homologues for Drosophila genes were sourced from these two databases, to increase coverage across the species depicted in the tree in Figure 4. Since these two databases use slightly different parameters to identify orthologs, we examined whether the usage of specific databases introduce bias by analyzing data from each database separately and observed that age index of each gene remained the same. Our comment to authors' response: We are glad that the authors carefully addressed our initial concerns about the reliability of results obtained from merging methods of gene homology detection. Since the observed age indices are not influenced by the database used to assign gene homology relationships, we agree that merging OrthoDB5 and OrthoMCL5 results do not bias this specific analysis. Reviewer summaryAll remaining concerns were carefully revised and we thank the authors for investing the additional time to respond to our review in such detail.

The structures in the telencephalon can be assigned either to its dorsal part, the pallium, or its ventral part, the subpallium1–3. The telencephalon of most vertebrates forms by an evagination of the neural tube, where the central lumen of the neural tube expands to form the two paired telencephalic vesicles1,3,4. However, in ray-finned fishes the rostral neural tube is thought to bend outward resulting in two telencephalic hemispheres separated by an unpaired ventricle and covered by a thin roof plate, thus referred to as “everted”1,3,4. In the rayfin teleost zebrafish, it has been shown that the morphogenetic movement that creates this different layout of the telencephalon does not result from a simple lateral outward bending of the telencephalic walls5. Instead, telencephalon morphogenesis comprises first the generation of a ventricular outfolding between telencephalon and diencephalon, followed by an enlargement of the pallial territory rostrally5. The different development of the telencephalon results in an unpaired ventricle and a different arrangement of the parts in the pallium compared to all other vertebrates1,4,6. Hence, due to its everted nature, a comparison between the parts of the pallium of rayfin fishes and all other vertebrates has been difficult. The correct determination of homologous pallial areas between teleosts and tetrapods is critical for the usage of teleost fish as neurobiological models as well as models for human neurological diseases. In recent years, a variety of different studies have demonstrated that using the expression pattern of conserved developmental regulatory genes as landmarks is a useful approach to identify homologous subdivisions of brain regions between divergent vertebrate species. The advantage of using the expression of conserved developmental genes lies in the uncoupling of anatomical and developmental differences of the brain part of interest between divergent species. This approach has been especially valuable for the telencephalon with its great variability in morphology between vertebrate species and has led to the clarification of the homology within subdivisions of the telencephalon between different vertebrate species, such as the domestic mouse, the chicken and the African clawed frog (e.g.7–22). For example, the gene expression of Tbr1 and Eomes (Tbr2) has been successfully used to identify the extent of the pallium in tetrapod embryos9,21,23. In addition, absence of Emx1 expression and presence of Tbr1 expression delineate the ventral pallium in tetrapod embryos9,10,12,13,21.The pallium in teleosts has generally been subdivided in a medial (Dm), dorsal (Dd), central (Dc), lateral (Dl) and posterior (Dp) part4. The pallium shows a notable structural variety and different subdivisions of these broad divisions have been described in different teleost species3,24–29. The subdivisions of the pallium and their homologies to nuclei in other vertebrate species have not been resolved, but different models based on neurochemical and connectional data have been suggested3,29–38. Ablation experiments combined with behavioral experiments suggest that the lateral nucleus of the pallium shows a similarity in function to the hippocampus and the medial nucleus of the pallium to the amygdala of amniotes39–43. Based on the expression of nicotine adenine dinucleotide phosphate diphorase (NADPHd) and Parvalbumin, a new model of four subdivisions (Dm, Dc, Dl, and Dp) has been proposed for the adult zebrafish pallium32. However, a comprehensive study of pallial subdivisions based on different conserved molecular markers is still missing in the adult zebrafish.The object of this study was to analyze expression of conserved marker genes to identify subdivisions within the adult zebrafish pallium. Here, we investigated the expression patterns of the molecular marker genes emx1, emx2, emx3 to identify a ventral pallial subdivision both in the larval and adult zebrafish pallium. The expression of Prox1 in a dorsal subdivision of Dl caudally suggests that it is homologous to the dentate gyrus in mouse. Combinatorial expression of ascl1a, emx1, emx2, emx3, and eomesa shows four main divisions in the pallium, Dm, Dc, Dl, and Dp. The combinatorial expression pattern also suggests a subdivision of Dl in a dorsal and ventral subdivision (which we have named Dld and Dlv, respectively).","20 Feb 2015","Approved","Steve Wilson, Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London, UK","Author Response 04 Nov 2015"," In teleosts, the pallial telencephalon undergoes eversion during its development rather than the more common evagination that occurs in other vertebrates.  These differing modes of morphogenesis have made it difficult to resolve homologies between pallial domains in teleosts and other vertebrates.  This paper describes the pallial expression of zebrafish orthologues of genes that have helped to define pallial sub-domains in other vertebrates.   The methods are clearly described, the data are of high quality and the discussion of results are balanced and informative.  The authors acknowledge the limitations of using gene expression patterns and suggest additional experimental approaches that could be used to address the validity of hypotheses raised in the discussion of the data.   There is a great deal of information of use for comparative neuroanatomy studies and some observations challenge current models of teleost telencephalic organisation.  The expression analyses suggest that pallial sub-divisions show considerable variation from rostral to caudal telencephalon and it will be interesting to study how such organisation arises during development. I have no revisions that I consider to be essential.  I think that Monica Flogueira's concern about the summary figure potentially being misleading could most simply be addressed by adding a question mark after the suggested homology term.

Continue reading We thank Monica Folgueira for her helpful comments and suggestions.Based on their expression analysis, authors identify five subdivisions of the pallium that they name as Dm, Dlv, Dld, Dc and Dp after adapting nomenclature from Mueller et al. (2011). I think it could be clearer in the text how data supports the division between “Dc” and “Dld” at rostral levels.The difference between Dc and Dld is the absence of emx3 positive cells in Dld. We have included this point in the discussion to make it clearer and now write:“Dld is different from Dc based on absence of emx3 positive cells in Dld.”In addition, as authors show that “Dld” represents a different histogenic unit to “Dlv”, I wonder if “Dld” could be equivalent to “Dd/Dld” of other teleosts. Maybe authors could comment on this in the manuscript.The unit ‘Dld” could be an equivalent to “Dd/Dld” of other teleosts (such as in trout). As there are, however, to our knowledge, no good markers that have been used to identify “Dd/Dld”, we do not want to introduce another subdivision that has not been used so far in zebrafish. It would be really interesting though to test if our proposed subdivision “Dld” is equivalent to “Dd/Dld”.eomesa and Prox1 seem to show differences between anterior and posterior regions of Dld. Yet, authors consider Dld as a continuous unit. Dc also seems to show differences from rostral to caudal levels (e.g. emx2+ is only expressed in a caudal portion of Dc, while eomesa is only expressed in a rostral portion). Thus I wonder if more subnuclei could be identified in the zebrafish pallium, thus the organization of the pallium being even more complex. Maybe authors could comment on these observations (if correct).We have included different color coding in our summary figure to reflect these changes in gene expression (light green – medium green – dark green for Dc, and light yellow – dark yellow for Dld). We have also added an explanation to this color code in the figure legend and write:“The different shades of green (Dc) and yellow (Dld) indicate gene expression changes along the rostro-caudal axis.”At this point, we have avoided adding additional subdivision acronyms as they might be potentially confusing especially when comparing the subdivisions in zebrafish to other teleost species.Authors discuss the divisions of the zebrafish pallium as corresponding to histogenic units of other vertebrates (ventral, lateral, dorsal and medial pallium). In addition, they propose certain homologies for specific nuclei, such as “Dm” being homologous to the “pallial amygdala” or “caudal part of Dld” homologous to the “dentate gyrus”. In my opinion, it is right to propose and discuss about such putative homologies in the manuscript. However, in my opinion, they are too speculative to be included in a summary figure, as this could mislead readers. I suggest removing these homologies from diagrams A-D in Figure 5, just referring to putative homologies for histogenic units.We have adopted the suggestion from the reviewer Steve Wilson to add a question mark to figure 5 (“Putative homologous region in the tetrapod pallium (?)”) to indicate that the putative homologies that we propose based on our work will need additional studies. We also point this out both in the figure legend of figure 5 and at the beginning of the discussion.Minor comments:Discussion: authors state that ‘Our gene expression data is consistent with the second part of the “modified pallial eversion model” of Mueller and colleagues’ To me, it is not clear what to authors mean by “second part of the modified pallial eversion model”.We have clarified the text and now write:“Our gene expression data is consistent with the “modified partial pallial eversion model” of Mueller and colleagues with regard to Dc.” Figure 1C-D: ventricular expression is not clear in the original data sets.The cells at caudal levels of the telencephalon are scattered and a bit weaker labeled than at rostral levels, but there are scattered eomesa positive cells present at the ventricular zone of Dm at all levels.Figure 2C: Authors state that red lines indicate subdivisions based on the current marker.

Three structurally similar NOS isoforms have been identified in endothelial cells (eNOS), neuronal tissues (nNOS) and in macrophages (iNOS)3. Different from eNOS and nNOS, iNOS is not expressed in resting cells but induced upon inflammatory and immunologic stimulation. Each NOS protomer consists of an oxygenase and a reductase domain. In the catalytic oxygenase domain (NOSoxy), dioxygen (O2) binds to a central heme prosthetic group, anchored to the polypeptide chain via a proximal cysteine residue (Figure 1). Its thiol sulfur atom accepts a hydrogen bond from an adjacent tryptophan residue. The substrate, L-Arg, is accommodated directly on top of the heme plane in the distal pocket; the cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin, H4B, binds along the side of the heme4–7. L-Arg and H4B are linked through an extended hydrogen bonding network mediated by one of the heme propionate groups. The reductase domain, NOSred, binds flavin mononucleotide (FMN), flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). It provides the electrons for the catalytic reaction proceeding in the oxygenase domain. In a first step, L-Arg is converted to N-hydroxy L-Arg (NOHA). Subsequently, NOHA is decomposed into citrulline and nitric oxide (NO). Electron transfer is enabled by calmodulin binding in the interface between the two domains8.Figure 1. Schematic depiction of the iNOSoxy active site (pdb codes 1NOD and 1DWV).The CO ligand was added for illustration.The NO molecule generated during enzymatic turnover can either coordinate directly to the heme iron or diffuse out of the protein into the environment. From there, it may again bind in a bimolecular process9. Formation of the very stable ferrous NO complex results in self-inhibition of the enzyme. The probability of forming this product depends on the dissociation rate coefficient of NO from the ferric heme, the likelihood of autoreduction of the ferric NO-bound form to the ferrous derivative with its much stronger NO affinity, and the probability of oxidizing the ferrous NO-bound species to the ferric form plus nitrate by O210. Deactivation of the enzyme may also occur via nitrosylation of the side chains of two cysteine residues coordinating a zinc ion in the dimer interface, which leads to irreversible dissociation into non-functional monomers11–14.The iNOS isoform has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases; so there is a growing interest in developing potent and highly selective inhibitors15,16. Their targeted design requires detailed insights into the interactions between ligand, substrate and the surrounding protein matrix. Therefore, we have investigated ligand and substrate binding in the iNOS oxygenase domain, iNOSoxy, by using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy of the stretching vibrations of carbon monoxide (CO) and NO as ligands rather than the physiological ligand O2. They are of similar size as O2, which suggests that ligand dynamics within the protein may be comparable for all three ligands. CO and NO both have excellent properties as infrared (IR) spectroscopic probes17. CO has proven to be an attractive heme ligand because the CO bond stretching vibration gives rise to strong mid-IR absorption bands that can be measured with exquisite sensitivity and precision17,18. The IR bands are fine-tuned by electrostatic interactions with the environment19–21; therefore, CO is frequently utilized as a local probe of protein structure and dynamics22.In the gas phase, CO absorbs at 2143 cm-123. When bound to the central iron of a heme cofactor, the CO stretching frequency, <U+03BD>CO, which is typically in the 1900 – 2000 cm-1 spectral range, is susceptible to changes in the iron-ligand bond and the local electric field due to the vibrational Stark effect24–29. There are two major contributions to the heme iron-CO bond, i.e., s-donation from a weakly antibonding 5s MO of CO to the iron 4s and 3dz2 orbitals and p-backbonding from the iron 3dz orbitals to the strongly antibonding CO 2p* orbital30. A positive charge located near the CO oxygen attracts electron density, causing a decrease in s-donation and an increase in backbonding. Consequently, the C–O bond order is reduced and <U+03BD>CO shifts to lower values19–21. A negative charge has the opposite effect.After photodissociation of CO-bound heme protein samples, the stretching bands of unbound CO trapped inside a protein are found within the range from ~2080 to ~2160 cm-118,31. The vibrational bands can reveal changes related to ligand relocation to other sites within the protein18,29,32,33, rotational motions of the ligand in these sites25,34 and protein conformational changes35. Often, there are doublets of bands corresponding to opposite orientations of the CO at a particular transient docking site27,29,32,36–38. The bond order and, therefore, <U+03BD>CO increases if the carbon atom interacts with a hydrogen bond donor, whereas an interaction with the ligand oxygen reduces both the bond strength and the stretching frequency29.Unlike CO, which only binds to a ferrous (FeII) heme iron, NO may coordinate to both the ferrous and the ferric (FeIII) forms. So far, FTIR studies using NO have remained scarce because of its weaker intrinsic absorption. Furthermore, there is spectral overlap with the amide bands and ultrafast recombination of a major fraction of proteins even at very low temperatures. Therefore, only small photoproduct yields are obtained in experiments probing longer times such as FTIR, which renders experiments with ferrous NO technically challenging. Consequently, we have limited ourselves to NO binding to ferric heme in this work. For iNOS, this complex is of physiological relevance because the heme iron is in the ferric state after completion of the catalytic cycle.Here, we have performed FTIR studies on iNOS at cryogenic temperatures, at which ligand rebinding is very slow. Thus, photoproducts induced by illumination are long-lived and can be conveniently studied by photolysis difference spectroscopy. Moreover, essentially all protein (and solvent) motions are frozen in39,40, so the ligands cannot escape to the solvent and can be observed within the protein matrix. We have combined FTIR with temperature-derivative spectroscopy (TDS)41–43, which allows us to disentangle photolysis-induced absorption changes caused by the different types of ligand dynamics.","05 Dec 2014","Approved","Marius Schmidt, Department of Physics, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, WI, USA",NA," This is a very interesting investigation on protein ligand interaction in iNOS.

Yet, environments typically deviate from these conditions. In some cases individuals can adapt to changes by sensing the environment and modifying their phenotypes accordingly, which is known as phenotypic plasticity1. However, if the sensing mechanism is too costly, phenotypic plasticity may not be optimal even in the presence of environmental variation. Differentiation on a stochastic basis into different phenotypic states adapted to different environments, also known as risk spreading or bet hedging, has also been proposed as an adaptation to environmental variation2–6. Dormant states have often been described as such bet hedging strategies. Examples include plant seed dormancy7, arthropod diapauses8 and bacterial sporulation9. For entering and exiting the dormant state, cells or organisms depend on environmental cues. Yet, these cues are not always reliable indicators of the future environment. Therefore, in such unpredictable environments it pays off for a plant, for instance, to have its seeds germinating stochastically at different time scales to insure that at least some of them will germinate at the time that is beneficial for its growth7.Here we focus on the dormancy of the cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum as an adaptation to nutritional stress. D. discoideum amoebae live in soil where they feed on bacteria and divide mitotically. When starved, cells enter into the dormant social phase of the life cycle. Up to 106 cells aggregate to form a multicellular organism that goes through a “slug” stage followed by the formation of a fruiting body. The slug is a motile, chemotactic and phototactic worm-like structure that senses and moves towards environments that are favorable for dispersion, germination and cell proliferation. The fruiting body is a sessile mushroom-like structure with the spore mass sitting on top of a stalk. Dormant spores can survive for months in the absence of food, and germinate into single cells upon dispersion towards nutritive areas. The stalk lifts the spores from the ground, which helps spore dispersion. Cells in the stalk, which represent ~20% of the total cell population, die owing to the metabolic cost of making up the stalk10.Its social behavior has made D. discoideum a very popular system for studying altruism, cheating and cooperation11,12, but not all aspects of its population-level adaptation to stress have been studied. Our main motivation was to study a previously known but neglected fact that not all cells aggregate upon starvation13. We have thus revisited the D. discoideum population-level response to nutritional stress by focusing on the aggregation stage. Incomplete aggregation may have significant evolutionary consequences. Aggregation is costly due to the death of stalk-forming cells and the arrest of cell division during fruiting body formation, which is an irreversible process14. Cells that do not aggregate do not pay these costs and may have the advantage of resuming growth immediately upon arrival of new nutrients. If conditions improve quickly, non-aggregating cells thus may have an important adaptive advantage.In this study we present the first attempt to describe the D. discoideum response to starvation as a functional partitioning into two states: aggregating and non-aggregating. We focus on two major points: (i) establishing the phenotypic and genotypic sources of population partitioning and (ii) assessing the evolutionary significance of such partitioning. In microbial systems, cell states such as cell cycle phase, nutritional state or age are sources of phenotypic heterogeneities9,15. Besides, different genetic backgrounds could give rise to different degrees of heterogeneity, giving insights into underlying molecular mechanisms. Here we develop a new technique based on quantitative live cell microscopy to analyze the effects of cell nutritional state, genetic background and environmental organization on population partitioning between aggregating and non-aggregating cells. In addition, we propose a model based on experimentally determined parameters to illustrate the potential evolutionary significance of population partitioning in fluctuating environments.","05 Dec 2014","Approved","Paul Rainey, NZ Institute For Advanced Study, Massey University, New Zealand",NA," I approve the authors' revision.

This exemplar tetrameric assembly is a component of virtually all biochemistry textbooks, which emphasize its role in reversible molecular oxygen binding. Yet, the superfamily of Hbs is distributed in all domains of life, and phylogenetic analyses have traced its origins to the Archean eon, an era that preceded by billions of years the evolution of highly specialized proteins for the storage and delivery of dioxygen. In contrast to our detailed knowledge of Hbs from animals, little information is available about other Hbs; in fact, it can be said that the cellular functions of the majority of Hbs remain open to investigation.Sequence data organize the Hb superfamily in three ancient lineages: M (myoglobin-like, containing the vertebrate Hbs), S (sensor-like), and T (truncated)1. The T lineage of interest to this report has representatives (TrHbs) in prokaryotes, fungi, and Viridiplantae1–3. Although many TrHb genes have been identified through genome sequencing, only a few have undergone biophysical examination at the protein level. Even fewer have been investigated within their native cell, in large part because of the difficulty in characterizing non-essential proteins present at low (nM) levels in organisms that cannot be cultured or are non-transformable. This “glaring lack of reliable information on function”4 contrasts with the ever-growing collection of sequences and prevents a complete understanding of the determinants of reactivity in Hbs. A considerable challenge in Hb research is deciphering how evolution has harnessed the helical folds of the M and S lineages (“3/3” helical arrangement) and the T lineage (“2/2” helical arrangement) to adapt to various environments and metabolic needs.Much insight regarding TrHbs and their relationship to other Hbs has been based on experimentation using engineered, recombinant proteins. Although indispensable for an understanding of Hb chemistry, the use of recombinant material carries an important caveat. Unless the protein is extracted from the native cell, doubts should remain regarding the identity of the cofactor, if any, that is associated with the polypeptide in vivo. This is especially true for the proteins of photosynthetic organisms because a variety of hydrophobic chromophores may be available5 to occupy the heme cavity and perform functions independent of dioxygen binding. Co- and post-translational modifications of the polypeptide chain and the cofactor are also possible and can be assessed only with the native material. Thus, it is essential to inspect the properties of the native protein to validate the biophysical data.THB1 is a TrHb from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. This unicellular, diflagellate alga is a key model organism, used in diverse fields such as microbiology6, developmental biology7, photosynthesis8, optogenetics9, synthetic biology10 and biofuels11. In prior work, we prepared recombinant apoprotein based on the THB1 gene from C. reinhardtii. The holoprotein was then reconstituted with a ferric b heme and purified in vitro. This recombinant THB1 (rTHB1) remains a monomer even in concentrated (mM) solutions. Using mutagenesis, optical absorbance, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we identified the axial ligands to the heme iron as the proximal histidine and a distal lysine in both the ferric and ferrous states. We also determined that the distal lysine can be displaced by the diatomic molecules that are common ligands to other Hbs (O2, CO, NO•). In vitro, rTHB1 was found to possess the nitric oxide dioxygenase activity also exhibited by many Hbs12. Interestingly, in vivo studies performed in parallel with these recombinant studies linked the expression of THB1 to the NIT2 transcription factor13. This transcription factor is the only known positive acting regulatory factor for the induction of genes required for the nitrate assimilation pathway14. The inducible control of THB1 by NIT2 strongly suggests THB1 is also involved in nitrate metabolism.rTHB1 displays novel physico-chemical properties and is suitable for further analysis. The THB1 protein expressed in vivo has unique physiology and is present in an extensively characterized model organism. With these combined attributes, THB1 is an excellent protein to gain a deeper understanding of TrHbs. We describe here a traditional biochemical approach to the characterization of the protein expressed in its native environment with the goal to correlate the recombinant protein used in biophysical studies with the native protein.","12 Jan 2015","Approved","Suman Kundu, Department of Biochemistry, University of Delhi, India",NA," Expanding genome sequence data has led to the discovery of a plethora of hemoglobins from diverse organisms through bioinformatics analysis of signature sequences. The verification of putative hemoglobins from such genomes, however, came only from investigation of recombinant hemoglobins in heterologous system. For way too long we have dabbled in understanding of biochemical, kinetic and structural properties of such recombinant hemoglobins. While such investigations have unraveled key insight and unique features of the novel hemoglobins with hypothesis for putative functions in vivo, a final word on their function is still awaited. The non-essentiality of these genes, their low physiological concentrations and lack of obvious relations to phenotypes has also kept an insight into their functional roles at bay from occasional in vivo genetic studies. A potential source of further insight into these proteins might thus lie in their post-translational modifications, modifications of the heme or their ability to interact with other key proteins in vivo, thus playing key roles at the proteome level. The investigation by Johnson and Lecomte addresses this key issue by characterization of an algal hemoglobin from native source in comparison to its recombinant counterpart. The experiments have been beautifully executed and the conclusions carefully laid down. While several properties of the native protein are indeed similar to the recombinant version, the N-terminal acetylation of the native hemoglobin indeed reveal new opportunities in understanding the function of these classes of proteins. It would have been exciting to see similarities or differences in the kinetic properties (on rates, off rates and ligand binding affinities) of the recombinant and native algal hemoglobins, which can provide additional information into their ligand-dependent functional roles. I am sure that the authors themselves or some other group will investigate this aspect as well in the near future. I am hopeful that this pioneering investigation will inspire other similar studies taking us into yet unknown territories of hemoglobin features and functions.   I have read this submission.

In animal cells, the external leaflet of plasma membranes (PMs) is mainly composed of phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin and cholesterol while the inner leaflet contains significant amounts of phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine2. Studies on in vitro model systems such as membranes isolated from cells or liposomes prepared either with synthetic lipids or extracted from PMs of cells from various sources have been instrumental in understanding the formation of lipid domains in biological membranes3,4. For example, pure sphingomyelin is known to form solid like phase (So) at physiological temperature5, due to its long acyl chain. In cell membranes containing cholesterol, however, cholesterol and sphingomyelin have been shown to interact and form liquid ordered phases (Lo) surrounded by a liquid disordered phase (Ld) essentially comprised of phosphatidylcholine2.Results obtained with artificial model membranes are, however, difficult to transpose to natural membranes and research performed on intact live cells is preferred6. In this context, fluorescent probes incorporated directly into cells are used extensively to reveal and characterize lipid domains, at sufficiently low concentrations that they should cause minimal disturbance to the membrane organization7,8.For labelling biological membranes, two main classes of fluorescent molecules are usually used8. The first one is composed of lipids such as phospholipids, sphingolipids, gangliosides or cholesterol that are attached to classical fluorescent dyes like fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and nitro benzoxadiazol (NBD)9,10. Such probes can be used to image domains because of their preferential partitioning to certain phases in models as well as in cell membranes11. The phase preference of these dyes is a subtle equilibrium between the fluorescent part of the molecule, the acyl chains and the interaction with the surrounding lipids of the membrane, thus some narrow changes in molecular interactions may shift the probe partitioning12,13. The second class of dyes developed for studying order in biological membranes are molecules with fluorescent moieties which are highly sensitive to the surrounding micro-environment. One of the most commonly used families of probes is laurdan and its derivatives14,15, whilst other probes include Nile Red16, di-n-ANEPPDHQ17, 3-hydroxy-flavone18 and 2-anthroyl lipid derivatives19. For such probes no preferential phase partitioning is expected.Laurdan, and other related fluorescent molecules containing 2-hydroxy-6-dodecanoyl naphthalene are environment-sensitive dyes which exhibit a large Stokes shift correlated to the polarity of the surrounding medium20,21. This effect comes from intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) when solvent relaxation occurs, as well as from local excitation (LE), without solvent relaxation22. In polar solvents, the emission is red shifted compared to apolar ones23. When laurdan is embedded in lipid bilayers that contain no sterol, a transition from solid (So) to liquid disorder (Ld) phases results in a large red shift20. The fluorescence modulation can originate from complex processes including reduced solvent relaxation due to lipid packing and high micro-viscosity, abrupt water molecules gradient through lipid bilayers24, possible H-bonding with donor lipid groups25 and/or dyes bending and sliding along the z-axis26. Complex lipid mixtures including sphingomyelin and cholesterol can also modulate the fluorescence parameters due to specific lipid/lipid and lipid/dye interactions27. Recently, Kim et al.15 synthesized and characterized C-laurdan, which also shows great sensitivity to changes in lipid order in the bilayers, but labels the plasma membrane of cells more efficiently than laurdan. Because C-laurdan is not commercially available, we decided to synthesize it ourselves. To achieve this, we revisited the synthesis of 2-hydroxy-6-dodecanoyl naphthalene, the precursor of laurdan, which also provided us with access to two new candidate probes molecules that we called M-laurdan and MoC-laurdan, in addition to laurdan and C-laurdan. Here we report the thorough characterization of the photophysical properties of these four probes in parallel, both in solvents and in model membranes. We also show their possible use to label live tissue culture. We show that, among the four candidate probes, M-laurdan looks as a particularly interesting alternative to laurdan or C-laurdan to label live cells.","21 Nov 2014","Approved","John D Bell, The College of Life Sciences, Brigham Young University, UT, USA",NA," The latest revisions have improved the paper.

As a commensal organism, it colonizes the skin and nares, and as a pathogen, it causes a variety of infections ranging from superficial skin abscesses to more serious diseases such as pneumonia, meningitis, endocarditis, septicemia, and toxic shock syndrome1. The success of S. aureus as a pathogen relies on its ability to adapt to a wide variety of environmental conditions and to resist host innate immune defense mechanisms2. The extensive use of antibiotics and the adaptability of S. aureus have led to the emergence of multidrug resistant strains in hospital and community settings3.In prokaryotes, environmental cues are channeled inside the cell via two-component systems (TCS). A typical TCS is composed of a membrane-bound histidine kinase (HK) sensor and a cognate response regulator (RR) protein. Each organism has a number of these systems that are specialized to respond to a specific cue, despite the conserved nature of domain organization and structural similarities among them4.The glycopeptide resistance-associated TCS GraSR, in which GraS is the histidine kinase and GraR is the response regulator protein, regulates the resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs) in S. aureus5,6. S. aureus resistance to CAMPs involves an increase in the positive cell surface charge through D-alanylation of wall teichoic acid (WTA) and lysinylation of phosphatidyl-glycerol within the cell membrane7,8. Both processes are mediated by enzymes encoded by the dltABCD and mprF operons, respectively. GraR is directly involved in regulation of these two operons6,9,10. Induction of these two operons is selective, and CAMPs such as RP-1 (platelets) and polymyxin B are capable of inducing mprF and dltABCD, but cationic molecules such as vancomycin, gentamicin or calcium-daptomycin are not11.In vivo studies showed that sensing and signaling of CAMPs in S. aureus relies on an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, encoded by the vraFG operon6 and the third gene of graRS operon, graX12. The vraFG operon is regulated directly by GraR, whereas the graXRS promoter is not regulated by GraR. The ABC transporter VraFG is composed of a membrane spanning domain protein, VraG, and an ATP-binding protein, VraF. It is proposed that the ABC transporter senses the presence of CAMPs and transduces the signal through GraSR with assistance from GraX12. Resistance to CAMPs relies on GraR, but not on the ABC transporter, as overexpression of GraR reverses the effect of vraFG, graS, graR or graX deletion. Furthermore, the independence of CAMPs resistance from the ABC transporter suggests that VraG does not function as a detoxification element12.While the ABC transporter is considered to be the sensor for CAMPs, the mechanism of signaling through GraSR and the role of GraS in this process remains unknown. In a typical TCS, the HK becomes active upon sensing an extracellular stimulus in a process that requires phosphorylation of a conserved histidine residue in the cytoplasmic portion of the HK. The information is then transduced to the cognate RR in a second phosphorylation process, whereby a conserved aspartate residue of the receiver domain of the RR becomes phosphorylated. This phosphorylation step modulates the activity of RRs, which often have transcriptional regulatory activities4,13.Herein, we investigated the autophosphorylation activity of GraS and its interaction with GraR and took a close-up look at the interactions among GraS, GraR, GraX and VraF. For the latter, we cloned, expressed and purified for the first time the GraX and VraF proteins. As a reference in our study of signal transduction mechanism by GraSR, we used a homolog of GraSR in Bacillus subtilis, the BceSR TCS14. There is a 36% sequence identity between GraS/BceS (Figure S1) and 56% sequence identity between GraR/BceR. BceSR is involved in signaling and resistance to bacitracin. Like GraSR, BceSR relies on an ABC transporter for sensing bacitracin; however, unlike GraSR, its ABC transporter also acts as a detoxification element. Both RRs do not regulate the expression of their respective operons14,15.Our study shows that the cytoplasmic domain of GraS, unlike BceS, does not have autokinase activity and does not interact with GraR. We show that the auxiliary protein GraX interacts with GraR and VraF. In addition, GraX and VraF interact with specific regions of GraS, and we propose that VraF may activate GraS. We see GraX as a bridge between GraS and GraR. Further, we show that there is no cross-talk between GraSR and BceSR, suggesting that, despite the similarities in primary sequences and domain organization between the respective HKs and RRs, other elements may determine the ultimate mechanism of signal transduction in a TCS.","02 Feb 2015","Approved with Reservations","Michael Otto, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, MD, USA","Author Response 10 Nov 2014"," The GraRSX (ApsRSX) system is a CAMP-sensing system that recently has been shown to also require the presence of VraFG, whose expression it regulates, for signal transduction. Muzamal et al. here performed several experiments to further delineate details of the signal transduction process of this system.They analyzed interactions between the different proteins (notably, however, lacking investigation of VraG), which led them to conclude that GraX may serve as a “scaffold” between the two systems. They found also that GraS, the histidine kinase part of the GraRS TCS, lacks autophosphorylation activity. I have several major problems with this report. The conclusions from new findings are not sufficiently backed by conclusive evidence, often based on negative results; and there are many open ends in the report. The overall picture of the mechanism of GraRSX/VraFG signaling is biased. Finally, the responses to major and valid concerns of the previous reviewer one are unsatisfactory.The finding that GraX is required for signal transduction and may serve as a “scaffold” between the Gra and Vra proteins is not novel. The authors fail to cite, like on many other occasions, evidence derived from the first investigation of the ApsRSX (GraRSX) system (ref. 10), which was undertaken in detail in S. epidermidis, whose system shares high similarity with that of S. aureus. It was shown in that study that ApsX (GraX) is needed for CAMP sensing/signal transduction. Furthermore, Falon et al. (ref. 12) already performed experiments clearly indicating that GraX has that scaffold function. This main message of the report thus lacks novelty. Admittedly, the authors for the first time used protein-based methods to substantiate that model – however, the used single method appears insufficient and technically problematic – see mainly point 2. Main conclusions are based on protein-protein interaction studies by pull-down assays. As correctly criticized by reviewer 2, who asked for further experiments with different methods analyzing interaction, results from such assays are difficult to interpret, as they are heavily dependent on the used conditions – especially when basing conclusions on negative results. This is the heart of the study, and to substantiate these results and provide a significant scientific advance, other methods must be used - especially given that Falon et al. already investigated those protein interactions with genetic tools and came to similar conclusions. The authors fail to correctly and sufficiently cite relevant findings from the literature, leading them to a biased presentation of the CAMP recognition mechanism. They state that GraS is not involved in CAMP sensing, despite clear evidence indicating otherwise. They only cite ref. 8 in that regard, in which it was shown that changing the extracellular loop of GraS results in changed CAMP sensing. They do, again, not cite ref. 10, in which experiments were performed further substantiating that role of GraS. There is certainly controversy regarding this question, but the way it is presented in this manuscript is biased, owing to the selective citing of previous studies. The authors draw conclusions about the lack of autophosphorylation activity of GraS from the investigation of a truncated GraS and from comparison to an only distantly (35% similarity) related system. This is not conclusive. Autophophorylation may need the whole protein and only because BceS undergoes autophophorylation under the tested conditions does not mean GraS would not under different ones. As pointed out already, important findings from the first study in S. epidermidis are not included and appropriately discussed. Furthermore, there has been evidence (ref. 8) that vraFG has an impact, although minor, on CAMP resistance – in contrast to what the authors state. Here again, different findings in the literature are reported in a selective fashion. The previous reviewer one had several important remarks, most of which were not addressed in a satisfactory fashion. That reviewer noted that conclusions from the comparison to the Bce system are difficult to interpret, owing to a lack of similarity and a difference in function. I concur with that notion – only because a remotely similar system shows an effect, and Gra proteins do not,  does not mean that Gra proteins would not show an effect under different conditions. The authors draw conclusions from negative results. Second, the reviewer asked for other types of interaction studies to substantiate the results from the pull-down experiments (see above). This was not addressed. Third, the authors did not address VraG, simply stating it is not amenable to their type of studies as it is a membrane protein. Then they should perform other studies, as requested. Fourth, the reviewer asked for footprinting assays to be performed with phosphorylated protein. I completely concur that it is vital, especially given the model the authors propose, to perform these studies with clearly phosphorylated or de-phosphorylated protein. The authors simply state in their response that GraR does not undergo auto-phosphorylation by acetyl phosphate. If the authors cannot achieve phosphorylation by acetylphosphate, they should at least completely de-phosphorylate and show that binding is affected by phosphorylation. Fifth, the reviewer had a valid concern stating that the data in Fig. 9 should be presented like those in Fig. 10 to clearly demonstrate the absence of non-specific binding. Here again, the authors simply stated that they believe the data in Fig. 10 are enough to rule out such non-specific binding. However, there are completely different protein-protein interactions that are investigated in Fig. 9.Further remarks: The authors should at least mention the other name of the system – ApsRSX. It was in the first report that demonstrated CAMP sensing of the system in S. epidermidis that it was named that way. In my opinion, the authors mainly must provide evidence for presence/lack of protein-protein interactions by a second method, in addition to answering appropriately to the other technical concerns and presenting a non-biased discussion about the sensing system. I have read this submission. I believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard, however I have significant reservations, as outlined above.

Such effects might often substantially contribute to therapeutic efficacy, for example, in cancer treatment3. The potentially far reaching consequences of drug polypharmacology for therapy, the frequency of these effects, and likely pros and cons are just beginning to be understood.Experimentally, promiscuity can be assessed by profiling of compounds or drugs on arrays of biological targets1,2, although such studies might often only provide an incomplete picture of in vivo effects. The same applies to computational estimates of promiscuity. Given the increasingly large amounts of compound activity data that are becoming available, the promiscuity of drugs and bioactive compounds can be explored through data mining by systematically evaluating activity annotations1. For the assessment of compound and drug promiscuity, public databases such as ChEMBL4, the major repository of compounds and activity data from medicinal chemistry, the PubChem BioAssay database5, the major repository of screening data, and DrugBank6, which collects approved and experimental drugs, have become indispensible resources.Computational analyses reported thus far have suggested different degrees of promiscuity among bioactive compounds and drugs, dependent on the compound sources used and the methods applied. For example, drug-target network analysis has indicated that a drug might on average act on two targets7. Other computational studies have suggested that drugs might on average interact with two to seven targets depending on the target classes the drugs are active against8. In addition to varying compound sources and analysis concepts, taking activity measurement characteristics and data confidence criteria into account is also of critical importance for compound promiscuity analysis. For example, it has been shown that the increase in the number of compounds with activity against targets from different families in ChEMBL has mostly resulted from assay-dependent IC50 but not (assay-independent) Ki measurements (equilibrium constants)9. In addition, by exclusively considering high-confidence activity data, it has been found that the majority of promiscuous bioactive compounds interact with two to five targets from the same target family, are predominantly active in sub-µM range, and display potency differences within one or two orders of magnitude against their targets10. This represents a prevalent promiscuity profile among bioactive compounds. On the basis of high-confidence activity data, it has also been calculated that compounds from ChEMBL interact on average with one to two targets and compounds from PubChem confirmatory assays with two to three targets11. By contrast, target annotation analysis has suggested that approved drugs interact on average with close to six targets, whereas experimental drugs (including candidates in clinical trials) interact with one to two targets11. The reasons for this apparent discrepancy in target numbers between drugs at different development stages are currently unknown. As increasing amounts of activity data become available, it is likely that recently detected promiscuity rates might further increase. However, the magnitude of such increases as a consequence of data incompleteness12 is difficult to predict, especially considering the low promiscuity rates that can currently be confirmed on the basis of high-confidence data1,11.In this study, we further extend the computational analysis of promiscuity by evaluating the progression of drug promiscuity rates over time, which required a systematic assessment of activity records with release dates. Different data selection criteria were applied and the calculated promiscuity rates were compared to available drug target annotations. Small to moderate increases in drug promiscuity over time were detected when high-confidence activity data were considered. Lowering the stringency of data selection criteria led to unrealistic estimates of promiscuity rates and their progression.","24 Oct 2014","Approved","Michael Walters, Department of Medicinal Chemistry, University of Minnesota, MN, USA","Author Response (Member of the F1000 Faculty and F1000Research Advisory Board Member) 20 Oct 2014"," The authors have presented an interesting and careful study on drug promiscuity as analyzed through available activity databases. The authors also illustrate the different conclusions that can be drawn based on the quality of the data analyzed. The discrepancies they point out highlight the importance of high-quality data when evaluating the promiscuity of drugs. The manuscript is clear and well-written, the methods are scientifically sound, and the analysis is thorough and clearly presented. Comments: “Compounds with multiple Ki or IC50 measurements for the same target were retained if all these values fell within the same order."" Should this read “…the same order of magnitude.”? “Surprisingly, for 282 drugs (~54%), no increase in promiscuity was detected on the basis of high-confidence activity records.” It would increase the impact of this article if the authors explained why this finding is surprising.  For example, do these compounds represent drugs that were highly optimized for a single target? “There were only 14 drugs with an increase in promiscuity rates by 10 or more targets.“ As above, the authors might want to add their thoughts as to why these drugs have such high promiscuity rates.  For example, are they kinase inhibitors which had known broad kinase panel activity and the complete scope of their kinase activity is only now coming to light? Suggestions for minor modifications: The dataset has been made publicly available through a DOI link. The link was broken when I attempted to follow it and look at the data. This link should be fixed.The authors have not provided any summary of the criteria used to determine what constitutes activity of a compound at a target (e.g. 10 µM cut-off? 100 µM?). If a strict cut-off cannot be given for each dataset, it is suggested that authors reported the range of activities reported in each dataset (one for the high-confidence data set, and one for each of the two low-confidence data sets). The authors mention that all the compounds were converted into SMILES strings during data analysis. It is suggested that the authors screen the SMILES list against a REOS/PAINS/etc. filters. It would be interesting to see if any of the high promiscuity compounds could be flagged as having substructures that could be responsible for non-specific activity. Or would have impeded the development of these drugs had they been prepared after cheminformatic filtering came into vogue. These suggested modifications would help increase the impact of this manuscript and could be of great interest to the drug discovery community.

Encouraged by the availability of non-invasive salivary hormone measurements, researchers in clinical, social, and personality psychology, among other fields, are increasingly incorporating hormonal measurements into their research in order to discover the impact of stress and other kinds of social or emotional stimuli on hormonal systems in human beings.Among many hormone-relevant psychological constructs, affiliation and bonding, and the converse, isolation and rejection, have received particular attention. Loneliness and lack of social support are known to have grave psychological and health impacts over time (see e.g. Hawkley & Cacioppo, 2010 for a review). Dysregulation in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, resulting in e.g. chronically high levels or dyregulated diurnal patterns of glucocorticoids, has been proposed as one possible mechanism mediating the connection between isolation and poor health (Hawkley & Cacioppo, 2010). This idea is supported by evidence that loneliness correlates with higher levels of cortisol, the primary glucocorticoid in humans (Hawkley & Cacioppo, 2010); the fact that social isolation is a potent stressor and elicitor of glucocorticoid release in other social animals, such as rats and sheep (e.g., Hermes et al., 2009; Rivalland et al., 2007); and that dysregulated or chronically high glucocorticoid levels are linked to a number of health consequences (Sapolsky, 2002; Tsigos & Chrousos, 2002). However, the relationships between social isolation, HPA axis activation, and health are complex and still not understood completely – including how acute social rejection, one source of isolation or loneliness, affects physiology. It is necessary to study these relationships on both a macro-level in real-world, longitudinal data (e.g., chronic loneliness/isolation) and also at a micro-level in controlled laboratory settings (e.g., acute social rejection) in order to precisely define the mechanisms involved.Researchers have used laboratory rejection tasks such as Cyberball — a ball-playing game in which other players exclude the participant — in order to test both the psychological and hormonal effects of social rejection (Maner et al., 2010; Stroud et al., 2002; Williams et al., 2000; Zwolinski, 2012). However, studies have failed to find consistent hormone responses to rejection (Zwolinski, 2012). There has also been evidence of sex differences in hormonal responses to rejection (Stroud et al., 2002), but these effects were not replicated in a separate study (Linnen et al., 2012). It is important to determine whether rejection in a laboratory setting can elicit an HPA axis response, and if so, in which sex or sexes.Psychological factors known to influence the HPA axis include novelty, unpredictability, and a lack of control (Mason, 1975). A more recent meta-analysis identified social-evaluative threat as key in predicting HPA axis responsivity to laboratory stress tasks (Dickerson & Kemeny, 2004). Any or all of these factors might be present to some degree in a rejection situation, so a cortisol response to rejection in the laboratory could be expected. On the other hand, the main function of glucocorticoids is to mobilize energy, e.g. for fight-or-flight activities (Nelson, 2005; Sapolsky, 2002; Wirth & Gaffey, 2013). Therefore, glucocorticoids do not show a one-to-one relationship with negative affect, but instead are elevated in situations requiring energy, whether associated with negative affect or not; some examples include sickness, exercise, and giving a speech (Wirth et al., 2011; Wirth & Gaffey, 2013). Whereas commonly-used speech stressors require literally thinking on one’s feet and making a vigorous (and ultimately futile) attempt to impress the judges, social rejection in laboratory tasks like Cyberball may or may not demand any expenditure of energy – in fact, it may be a situation in which no obvious actions can be taken. Therefore, it is unclear whether laboratory social rejection is a context in which the brain and body would activate a system designed to replenish energy. The first goal of the present study, then, is to examine the effect of a popular rejection manipulation, Cyberball (Williams et al., 2000), on cortisol levels in men and women, alongside the effect of a well-studied, standardized laboratory stressor, the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST; Kirschbaum et al., 1993).In addition to cortisol, there is a growing body of literature linking progesterone levels/responses to both stress and to affiliation and rejection (Brown et al., 2009; Childs et al., 2010; Gettler et al., 2013; Maner et al., 2010; Schultheiss et al., 2003; Schultheiss et al., 2004; Wirth & Schultheiss, 2006; Wirth et al., 2007; Wirth, 2011). Progesterone is not only a gonadal hormone, but is also produced in the adrenal glands, and progesterone levels increase in response to pharmacological stimulation of the HPA axis (Genazzani et al., 1998). Progesterone and hormones synthesized from it (e.g., allopregnanolone) increase during stress in laboratory animals (Barbaccia et al., 2001; Paul & Purdy, 1992; Purdy et al., 1991), but it is as of yet unclear whether progesterone is part of the typical human stress response (Wirth, 2011). There is evidence that progesterone does increase alongside cortisol during venipuncture stress (Wirth, 2011), and also evidence that progesterone responds to the TSST stressor, at least in men, and in women in some menstrual cycle phases (Childs et al., 2010). Progesterone responses to laboratory stressors need to be studied systematically in both sexes, in part simply to understand stress physiology, but also because of important implications for understanding psychological disorders (e.g., lower allopregnanolone levels seen in depression; see Wirth, 2011 for a review). Furthermore, progesterone might be particularly associated with affiliation and rejection/isolation, as detailed below.Although cortisol and progesterone levels seem to rise and fall in tandem in humans (Wirth et al., 2007), a growing body of literature supports associations with affiliation that are unique to progesterone. First, implicit affiliation motivation – a personality construct measuring drive for friendly, warm contact with others - was increased in women taking oral contraceptives containing progestins, as well as in cycling women in the luteal phase, a time in the cycle of high progesterone levels (Schultheiss et al., 2003). Second, a rejection-themed film excerpt designed to produce affiliation-related stress caused increases in progesterone as well as cortisol; in addition, baseline (pre-film) affiliation motivation predicted stress-related increases in progesterone (but not cortisol), without regard to participant sex (Schultheiss et al., 2004; Wirth & Schultheiss, 2006). Third, women who took part in a closeness-generating task in pairs had progesterone increases in response to the task, compared to a control condition (Brown et al., 2009). Fourth, personality traits such as social anxiety and rejection sensitivity moderated progesterone responses to a laboratory rejection task (Maner et al., 2010). Finally, recent, preliminary research links progesterone to the beneficial effects of helping behavior on cardiovascular recovery from stress (Brown & Brown, 2011; Smith, 2011) and to positive mood during fathers’ interactions with their toddlers (Gettler et al., 2013).Given this evidence, along with evidence that progesterone may respond to typical laboratory stressors (Childs et al., 2010; Wirth, 2011), is not yet clear whether progesterone is a “generic” stress hormone, i.e. responding to all stressors along with cortisol, or whether it is tied specifically to affiliation stress/rejection. Notably, in some of the studies cited above, progesterone and not cortisol showed (positive) associations with affiliation (e.g. Wirth & Schultheiss, 2006). Thus, this evidence calls for further research elucidating progesterone’s role in stress, affiliation, and rejection. While there is at least one study of progesterone in the context of laboratory rejection tasks (Maner et al., 2010), moderating variables were the focus of that study; more work is needed to determine whether progesterone typically increases during rejection in human beings. Thus, the second goal of the current research is to test whether progesterone increases in response to either the rejection manipulation Cyberball, and/or a standard speech stressor (the TSST).In both goals of the present research, it is important to determine if there are sex differences. Men typically have larger cortisol responses to laboratory stressors than women do, despite women having equivalent, or even greater, self-reported mood responses (Kudielka & Kirschbaum, 2005). On the other hand, women are thought to be more sensitive to rejection than men (Stroud et al., 2002). In addition to cortisol, progesterone responsivity to both rejection and a speech stressor may have important sex differences (e.g., Childs et al., 2010). For these reasons, we collected data in both women and men exposed to Cyberball or the TSST.Our hypotheses were four-fold. We expected to (1) replicate substantial prior research (Dickerson & Kemeny, 2004; Kirschbaum et al., 1993; Kudielka & Kirschbaum, 2005) in that the TSST would cause increases in cortisol, particularly in men. We further hypothesized (2) that the TSST would have a greater effect on cortisol than would Cyberball, as the latter is not associated with clear needs for energy mobilization. As for progesterone, we hypothesized that (3) it would increase alongside cortisol in the TSST, as seen in men in at least one previous study (Childs et al., 2010). Given evidence for particular associations with rejection, we also hypothesized that (4) progesterone levels would be affected by Cyberball. We were agnostic as to whether this effect would be present in both sexes, given the paucity of published data on this topic.","05 Jan 2015","Approved","Jens Pruessner, Departments of Psychiatry, Psychology, Neurology and Neurosurgery, McGill University, QC, Canada","Author Response 03 Feb 2015"," I would like to thank the authors for addressing all points raised in response to the original version. The manuscript has been mostly improved as a result, with the added power analysis, comments on the menstrual cycle phase, clarification of the sex of the panel of judges, and clarification for the reason of the repeated freeze-thaw cycles. A few comments remain, which I'd like to list simply as points of reference for the authors, and readers. I am happy to approve the manuscript as is without reservation, but think it is useful to still communicate these comments as part of the manuscript to allow the reader to take them into consideration. The authors have added a power analysis, but the way the power analysis was conducted and presented is probably not 100% optimal. To use the effect sizes from your own sample for power analysis allows you to indicate how strong the effects were for those tests which came out significant, and how much variability was explained by the factors you manipulated and controlled. That is one aspect of power analysis. What might be important to  address in addition, however, is the question of what the chances were to observe a significant effect in your sample if it exists in the population, for those tests that were not significant in your study. In the context of the current study, two of the main effects in question did not show significance - a potential progesterone response to stress, and the effect of cyberball on cortisol. Thus, it would be important to indicate what the chances of the current study were to observe significant effects here if they existed in the population. I had suggested to use previous studies to estimate the expected effect size in their study and then calculate the power from that for your study, given your alpha-level and your sample size - in the current study, this would translate into finding previous studies that observed a progesterone response to stress, and previous studies that found an effect of the cyberball stressor on cortisol release, estimate the effect size from those studies, and use it to calculate the power to find an effect in the current study. Related to this, it is not sufficient to use one effect size from your own findings for all power analyses (in this case, the group by sex effect on cortisol) - you would want to conduct different power analyses with different effect size estimates depending on the effects under investigation. (See, for example, the article by O'Keefe on that topic: O'Keefe, D. (2007).  The authors were not very enthusiastic about the idea of using a within-subject design; this was a side point as their between-subjects design is certainly valid. However, the argument why a within-subject design might be suboptimal was not entirely convincing to me, either. While habituation to repeated exposure of the same stressor is a significant issue in stress studies, cross-habituation to laboratory stressors in general is less frequently investigated, and - at least to my knowledge - not frequently observed. In fact, the opposite phenomena, sensitization across different stressors, is more prominently investigated and discussed in the stress literature (which a simple search on PubMed using these keywords will reveal). While this would also add to the complexity of interpreting the results, randomization in the order of stressor presentation would help to interpret the results in either case. I certainly do agree with the authors that a full within subject design is impractical for the resulting 16 different orders. But a mixed within and between subject design would probably be feasible, reduce the number of cells substantially, and allow to co-investigate the TSST and the Cyberball task within the same person.  The menstrual cycle phase effects might go beyond the effects on changing hormone levels, also influencing what women perceive as stressful depending on the phase they are in (see the recent paper by Duchesne et al. (2013) on this topic). Thus, I think it is important to not only control for the baseline levels of hormones affected by the cycle, but ideally also keep the phase constant, or have enough subjects to include the phase as separate factor in the analysis. I thus am grateful that the authors have included a respective comment in the Limitations' section.  I thank the authors for clarifying that the increase between time point 3 and time point 4 in the women occurred in the TSST stress group. Regardless, the results depicted in Figure 2 still seem to suggest that the control version of the TSST also led to an - at least descriptive - increase in cortisol levels in the women between samples 3 and 4. I think this suggests that there are some aspects to the control version of the TSST that are perceived as stressful by at least some of the female participants - otherwise, you would expect to observe simply a decline of cortisol levels throughout the task, in line with the circadian rhythm of cortisol. As it is not clear what aspect of the TSST control version leads to the increase in cortisol, it would thus be advisable to not repeat any aspect of this task in any other task, as it otherwise might create a confound. The authors point out that the TSST control task is frequently used - I don't doubt that, but would argue that it doesn't matter. Repeating any aspect of one stress task in another will complicate the interpretation of the results, if the aim is to understand what is stressful about one task vs. another.  Thank you for clarifying that the judges' panel in the TSST was always sex/gender mixed. I think this is best practice to avoid any potential effect of the sex/gender of the panel on the results. Along the same lines, the fact that the Cyberball panel was always of the (perceived) same sex/gender raises the question of whether different results could be expected if the panel was of mixed, or opposite sex/gender. Thank you for clarifying why three freeze-thaw cycles were employed.  I have read this submission. I believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard. Competing Interests: No competing interests were disclosed.

Your points are well-taken. We would like to respond to Comment #1, regarding the post-hoc power analysis. You make a good point that there are limitations in calculating power from effect sizes calculated from one’s own sample. We did initially select .1 (partial eta squared / <U+03B7>2) because that was the effect size obtained in our ANOVA on cortisol. However, a partial <U+03B7>2 of .1 is also lower than effects obtained in relevant literature; our power analysis suggests we had sufficient power to detect those effects, as well. For example, Childs et al. 2010 (cited in the manuscript) found an effect of the TSST on progesterone for men (partial <U+03B7>2 = .5) and for women in the follicular phase (partial <U+03B7>2 = .26). We had 90% power to detect a considerably smaller effect size than these in our progesterone analysis (with N = 131, as in our cortisol analysis.) In other words, if the true/population effect size for effects of Cyberball or the TSST on progesterone is .1 or greater, our power analysis suggests that we had enough power in our study to have detected it. Although power of 90% still means we had a 10% chance of failing to detect a true effect, nonetheless, our power analysis lends greater confidence to our null findings. In the literature, we are aware of only one study aside from ours examining the effect of the Cyberball task on cortisol levels, Zwolinski (2012). In this study, Cyberball did not cause any appreciable change in cortisol levels; all groups displayed a drop in cortisol. If anything, in the group of women taking oral contraceptives, participants in the Cyberball Ostracism (exclusion) condition had more of a drop in cortisol levels compared with the Inclusion condition. However, when examining post-CB cortisol without subtracting pre-CB levels, two of the groups did have higher post-CB cortisol in the Ostracism condition: luteal phase women and women on oral contraceptives. The effect sizes for these effects were reported as .32 and .27 (partial <U+03B7>2) respectively, and .16 for the overall ANOVA which had the Group X Condition interaction. Once again, with 90% power to detect a partial <U+03B7>2 of .1, our study had adequate power to detect smaller effect sizes than those reported by Zwolinski (2012). Of course, the true/population effect sizes are not known. These are only estimated by our study and by other studies. Past literature as well as our present study both contain error in estimation of the true effect sizes, by the nature of random sampling. So, for a post-hoc power analysis, we aren’t much better off using effect sizes obtained in published literature, unless those studies had tremendously large sample sizes (not the case for Childs et al. or Zwolinski). Even in cases of very large sample sizes, which are better at estimating the population effect size, calculations of power still contain error from the true power – see Yuan & Maxwell (2005). We thank Elizabeth Page-Gould, Meghan Cain and Ke-Hai Yuan for statistical advice and consulting in thinking over these issues and preparing this response. Citations: Childs E, Dlugos A, De Wit H: Cardiovascular, hormonal, and emotional responses to the TSST in relation to sex and menstrual cycle phase.

A recently proffered approach to biomedical ventures endeavoring to delay aging, and thus increase healthspan (the period of life during which an organism is free of substantial morbidity or physiological disability/inability), begins with studying interventions that increase lifespan [Kenyon, 2010; Miller, 2009; Olshansky et al., 2007; Warner & Sierra, 2009]. Therefore, it is of high gerontological interest to study causal associations between longevity and physiological correlates that might result in anti-aging healthspan therapies based on engendering those physiological correlates, or that might serve as useful biomarkers for pharmacological or lifestyle interventions to delay the onset and/or decelerate the rate of senescence.The growth hormone receptor/binding protein (Ghr/bp) gene-disrupted (knockout) (GHR-KO) mouse is homozygous for a targeted disruption (knock-out, KO) of the growth hormone (GH) receptor (GHR)/binding protein gene, and is thus GH-resistant, resulting in decreased GH hormonal signaling. GHR-KO mice were generated by insertional mutagenesis that disrupted the Ghr/bp gene; this results in decreased hepatic production of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), which leads to markedly reduced levels of circulating IGF-1, a reduced growth rate, an approximately 20% reduction in adulthood length, and an approximately 40% reduction in adult body weight [Zhou et al., 1997].Of particular note, the GHR-KO mouse outlives its littermate control by approximately 40% [Coschigano et al., 2000; Coschigano et al., 2003].Produced in the ß-cells of the pancreatic Islets of Langerhans, the hormone insulin regulates metabolism and energy homeostasis, partly by inducing the tissue uptake of glucose from blood. The GHR-KO mouse exhibits markedly decreased plasma insulin levels, due partly to decreased proliferation of ß-cells [Liu et al., 2004]. As blood insulin concentration inversely mediates the systemic insulin sensitivity, insulin sensitivity is greater in the GHR-KO mouse than in its littermate control [Liu et al., 2004]. This is also the case with multiple other long-lived mice [Brown-Borg et al., 1996; Conover & Bale, 2007; Conover et al., 2008; Dominici et al., 2002; Selman et al., 2008].Results from survivorship studies reveal that aging-retarding (and thus, lifespan-increasing) dietary restriction (DR), including yet not limited to caloric restriction (CR), further increases insulin sensitivity and survivorship for some long-lived mutants, the Ames (Prop1df/df) Dwarf mouse [Bartke et al., 2001] and the growth hormone releasing hormone KO (Ghrh-/-) mouse (data not shown). However it has been reported that CR doesn’t influence insulin sensitivity, and only modestly increases the survivorship of females, in the GHR-KO mouse [Bonkowski et al., 2006].As an initial hypothesis, if CR fails to exert much effect on one senescence-associated trait (longevity) of the GHR-KO mouse because its level of insulin sensitivity is already as great as permissible for a viable animal, then a GHR-KO mouse on CR should not vary from a GHR-KO mouse on an ad libitum (A.L.) diet in other aging-associated characteristics (namely, metabolism and cognition).Therefore, we attempted to investigate whether insulin sensitivity is sufficient to explain the severely attenuated response to CR of slow-aging associated phenotypes in GHR-KO mice. Surprisingly, in the course of our experiments we discovered that CR actually increases blood insulin concentration and starkly reduces insulin sensitivity in GHR-KO mice. These results question the assertion that CR has no effect on GHR-KO mouse blood glucose homeostatic management and the relationship, if any, between insulin sensitivity and slowed senescence in GHR-KO mice.","12 Mar 2015","Approved","Florian Muller, Department of Genomic Medicine, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, TX, USA",NA," The study addresses a long running question in aging research, which concerns the interaction of the two regimes known to consistently extend mammalian (mouse) lifespan: caloric restriction and manipulation of the GH/IGF1 axis.The study provides a wealth of very useful endocrinological and metabolic data and the authors must be commended their extensive work. The interpretation with regards to the effects of insulin sensitivity and caloric restriction are plausible, though ultimately, whether this is truly the mechanism by which the lifespan-extending effects are mediated (and account for the differential response to CR in GHRko mice), will require direct experimental demonstration.I would like the authors to discuss the metabolic results a little more. For example, it is indicated that the total caloric output of GHrKO mice is higher, considerably so, than WT (regardless of CR). However, the heat production is more or less the same. At the same time, CR has opposite effects on hear production in GHRko versus WT mice. It would seem to me overall, that as a whole the metabolic effects of CR in table 3, are much attenuated in the GHRko mice, i.e. WT mice have much more profound alterations in metabolic parameters in response to CR than do GHRko mice to CR.These are just suggestions. Overall, the data and paper are very valuable as is. I have read this submission. I believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard.

This quest has been particularly driven by the limitations that the use of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) poses in patients with ischemic stroke (Fonarow et al., 2011). For Europe, it is projected that stroke events will increase from 20% in 2002 to 35% in 2050 in the population above 65 years of age (Truelsen et al., 2006). The United States report a yearly incidence of approximately 795,000, killing about 135,000 people each year (Roger et al., 2012). Most patients have to settle for the need of specialized care culminating into a burden to both persons affected and health care systems (Strong et al., 2007). Even though the potential of targeting neuroprotective pathways to treat ischemic stroke has been debated extensively, there seems to be a consensus towards more multilayered strategies (Iadecola & Anrather, 2011).Several neuroprotective proteins that play a role in the ischemic cascade have been identified and studied, such as cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), Akt, extracellular-signal regulated kinase (Erk1/2), or heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) (Qi et al., 2012; Roux & Blenis, 2004). The transcription factor CREB, for instance, exerts its neuroprotective role in the ischemic response by activating protective genes and trophic factors such as B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) or brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (Wilson et al., 1996). The protein-chaperone HSP27 inhibits pathways leading to cell death (van der Weerd et al., 2010). Finding a treatment targeting these proteins simultaneously could open a new window of opportunity in acute stroke management and regeneration.The role of different populations of adult stem cells is being investigated in several fields of regenerative medicine. Distant stem cells track sites of injury and counteract tissue damage (Assmus et al., 2011; Brunner et al., 2008; Lagasse et al., 2000). It is hypothesized that human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) produce cytokines and growth factors that subsequently repair damaged tissues, including the brain (Chen et al., 2001). After homing to the injured areas, where hypoxia, apoptosis, and inflammation occur, hMSCs secrete trophic factors that enable endogenous repair (Joyce et al., 2010). Hence, the scientific community endeavored to either infuse or inject stem cells in multiple organ-specific disease entities with only limited clinical success in myocardial infarction (Jensen & Patterson, 2013; Lemmens & Steinberg, 2013; Wollert & Drexler, 2010).In 2005, Thum et al. postulated in their “dying stem cell hypothesis” that therapeutic stem cells are already in the state of apoptosis while being processed for treatment, thus causing immune suppression by scaling down the adaptive and innate immune system (Thum et al., 2005). The authors speculated that these “therapeutic apoptotic stem cells” are able to attenuate hypoxia-induced inflammation (Fadok et al., 2001; Saas et al., 2010).We have extended this concept and utilized suspensions of apoptotic peripheral blood mononuclear cells (MNCs), rather than stem cells themselves, as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of rodent myocardial infarction in a previous study (Ankersmit et al., 2009; Hoetzenecker et al., 2012; Lichtenauer et al., 2011). The almost complete absence of long term myocardial scarring led us to newly validate the suitability of peripheral MNCs and their secreted factors for regenerative medicine. In our previous work we showed that first, human apoptotic MNC-secretomes (hMNCapo sec) circumvented inflammation and caused preferential homing of c-kit+/CD34- endothelial progenitor cells; second, hMNCapo sec caused immune suppression in vitro and, third, paracrine factors derived from human apoptotic MNC-secretomes led to an upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) and Interleukin 8 (IL-8) in primary cultured human fibroblasts. Both these factors are known to be involved in neoangiogenesis (Nold-Petry et al., 2010). In addition, hMNCapo sec have been shown to cause enhanced wound healing in vivo via the formation of new blood vessels and increased migration of primary cultured fibroblasts and keratinocytes (Mildner et al., 2013). Ultimately, one single intravenous administration of hMNCapo sec in a large animal closed chest reperfusion model of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) prevented myocardial damage (Ankersmit et al., 2009; Hoetzenecker et al., 2012; Lichtenauer et al., 2011).With these data at hand, we investigated in the present study whether secretomes derived from rat (rMNCapo sec) and human (hMNCapo sec) apoptotic MNCs are also able to reduce ischemic lesion volumes and improve neurological outcome in a rat MCAO (middle cerebral artery occlusion) model.","03 Nov 2014","Approved with Reservations","Johannes Boltze, Department of Cell Therapies, Fraunhofer-Institut für Zelltherapie und Immunologie IZI, Germany","Author Response 15 Oct 2014"," I want to thank the authors for their thorough amendments made on their paper. While not every single response is absolutely convincing (at least to me), the overall quality of the paper is clearly above average.Importantly, all study limitations are well discussed or are expected to be implemented in the next revision. Hence, the paper can be considered a good starting point for further investigations and clearly deserves a broad audience.Point 1:Physiological parameters to be assessed may also comprise non-invasively recordable items such as heart rate, core body temperature etc. If using the filament model as one of the more invasive approaches, blood samples can also be easily collected for basic blood chemistry including pH. The state-of-the-art of filament models also includes CBF monitoring (e.g. by Laser Doppler) during ischemia induction.The animal well-being argument is not completely convincing while the missing information are a relevant drawback of the paper and neglecting such information may easily induce a bias.However, such bias is at least partially compensated by randomization and this is the only severe flaw in my mind. Hence, thorough discussion of these limitations is sufficient given the ample high-quality information provided by the paper.Randomization strategy: my comment was rather directed towards the randomization method (e.g. throwing a coin, random generator etc.), but this is a minor point. A clear statement on randomization and blinding strategies is fine. Thanks for adding this.Point 2:Still a flaw, but OK for early exploratory research. The rationales provided in the response should be integrated in the manuscript to their full extent.Point 3 to 5:No additional comments.Point 6:In figure 1 it still reads “0,7” instead of 0.7.

This first investigation was mostly intended to show the potential of apoptotic MNC-secretomes in stroke rather than setting a particular time window for our treatment or being able to tell the best dosage for its application. We are aware of the limitations of this study design and we agree that additional experiments need to be done in order to see how the administration of apoptotic MNC-secretomes at different or, for that matter, later time points affect outcome after ischemic stroke.We applied the “human” dose twice in order to see if there was an additional benefit for the doubled dose. We agree, though, that rat and human apoptotic MNC-secretomes are hardly comparable, representing a limitation of this study. To avoid possible loss of potency in the xenogenic setting (human MNC-secretomes in rat MCAO) we decided to use treatment twice compared to only once in the allogeneic experiments (rat MNC-secretomes in rat MCAO), This approach further allowed us to reduce the required amount of animals according to the principle of the three R’s (replacement, reduction and refinement)[ref-1]. In the part “Neuronal sprouting assay”, the authors should describe with more precision the methods they employed for measurement of neurite length.Thank you for your comment.

Approximately one-third of psoriasis patients develop psoriatic arthritis2,3. The exact mechanisms underlying psoriasis remain under investigation. A complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors initiates a cascade of events that lead to activation of dendritic cells4. The activated dendritic cells stimulate differentiation and migration of effector T cells (Th1 and Th17) to the skin. The subsequent release of inflammatory cytokines promotes further recruitment of immune cells, stimulates keratinocyte proliferation and sustains a state of chronic inflammation4.Genomics, proteomics, and transcriptomics research has substantially contributed to the growing body of knowledge concerning psoriasis etiology. For example, genome-wide transcriptional analysis and association studies have identified new susceptibility loci that implicate pathways in psoriasis pathogenesis which integrate epidermal barrier dysfunction with immune dysregulation5–7. A recent proteomic analysis of psoriatic skin tissue identified 36 up-regulated proteins associated with the regulation of cell death, defense response, inflammatory response, and reactive oxygen species8. However, the data beyond genomics and proteomics at the metabolic level can provide new insights into the cellular processes involved in psoriasis.Metabolomics, the most recent addition to the “omics” fields, is the comprehensive study of all low molecular mass metabolites in the metabolome of an organism under a given set of conditions9. Examining the metabolic byproducts produced at the transcriptional and translational levels will yield clues to the cellular regulatory processes and underlying molecular networks. Because metabolites are the end products and the most downstream representation of cellular processes, the study of an organism’s metabolome is most reflective of any observable phenotype9. Metabolomics analysis will enable researchers to gain valuable information regarding the physiology of a system by measuring the amplified output that results from genetic and environmental perturbations10. To date, metabolomics has not yet been applied to investigate the systemic mechanisms underlying psoriasis.Because psoriasis is a multifactorial disease at the genomic, protein, and cellular levels, it is important to examine the end products of cellular processes in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. In this novel study, we employed a global metabolomics approach using gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS) to compare the serum metabolic profiles of patients with psoriasis, patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, and healthy controls. We then summarized our results within the context of existing literature to generate hypotheses for future targeted analysis. Integrating genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics and metabolomics data from all levels will add to our understanding of the physiological processes underlying this complex disease and will provide potential insights into its associated comorbidities.","06 Jan 2015","Approved","J Lee, The Permanente Medical Group, TPMB, CA, USA",NA," Interesting pilot study investigating metabolite differences between patients with psoriasis, those with psoriatic arthritis, and unaffected controls.

This late current represents a fraction of voltage-dependent Na+ channels that fail to inactivate after the initial opening. Instead, these channels change to a conformation with frequent late re-openings in a so-called burst mode2. Among other mechanisms, calmodulin kinase II overexpression in chronic heart failure increases the rate of transition to the late bursting mode conformation2. The phenomenon is also observed in Nav1.5 inactivation-deficient mutants, such as <U+0394>KPQ3 or 1795InsD4,5, leading to a specific form of congenital long QT syndrome, LQT-36–8.Given its role in cardiac arrhythmogenesis9,10, pharmacological inhibition of the late Na+ current component (INa late) is seen as an anti-arrhythmic strategy. Novel late sodium channel blockers, such as the partial fatty acid beta-oxidation inhibitor, ranolazine11–15, are used for both myocardial ischemia and to alleviate neuropathic pain and show a preferential affinity for the burst mode conformation of Na+ channels16–21. Other compounds, such as veratridine, a steroid-derived alkaloid extracted from rhizomes of Veratrum album or seeds of Schoenocaulon officinale22,23, preferentially bind to activated Na+ channels, impeding inactivation and leading to increased nerve excitability.The objectives of this study were to (1) record the veratridine-dependent increase in the late Na+ current using a HEK293 cell line stably transfected with human Nav1.524, (2) measure the ranolazine-induced inhibition of basal and veratridine-activated INa late, and (3) asses the effects of veratridine at the same concentrations on action potentials (APs) in hiPSC-cardiomyocyte preparations externally paced in current-clamp mode. In parallel we also tested the inhibitory effects of veratridine on hERG1 current in stably transfected HEK293 cells. All these experiments were performed using CytoPatch™2 automated patch-clamp equipment.","29 Oct 2014","Approved","Céline Fiset, Research Center, Montreal Heart Institute and Faculty of Pharmacy, Université de Montréal, QC, Canada",NA," In this study, Chevalier et al. had succeeded to record and analyse the late Na+ current (INaL) in HEK293 cells stably transfected with wild-type human SCN5A, using automated patch-clamp technology. They were able to accurately assess the effects of pharmacological agents on INaL. They showed that the cardiac INaL can be inhibited by ranolazine and activated by veratridine. Using fluctuation analysis, they hypothesized that ranolazine would act as an open pore blocker, reducing the open probability without affecting the number of active channels, while veratridine would increase the number of active channels without influencing their open probability. In addition, they also provided additional functional data by performing a series of automated patch-clamp experiments showing that application of veratridine concentrations that increased INaL but had no effects on HERG current prolonged the action potential duration of human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. This is an interesting and well-designed study that reports high quality data. Considering the role of late sodium current in the action potential duration, mainly under pathological conditions, and the difficulty to accurately record this small ionic current, the subject of this study is highly relevant. The demonstration of the suitability of the automated patch clamp technology to accurately measure the late sodium current and to assess the effects of pharmacological agents on this current is helpful. In addition, the use of the hiPSC –derived cardiomyoyctes with this approach is also interesting. I do not have any major issues to address. However, the paper could be improved by attention to the following points.  All experiments were performed at room temperature. Considering the limited amplitude of the late Na+ current under basal conditions, it could have been useful to perform these experiments at a more physiological temperature to help increase the amplitude of the current. In Figure 1B, it would have been interesting to also present the recordings with ranolaxine alone. The action potential was elicited by the injection of 2 nA of current. This is a rather large current and is probably not just-suprathreshold depolarizing current. Do the hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes usually require such a high current injection to elicit action potential? For the HERG recordings, is there any specific reason why the external concentration of KCl was only 2.5 mM? Data reported in Table 1 could have been normalized to the cell capacitance to report the current density instead of the current amplitude. For some statistical analysis, an ANOVA would have been more appropriate that a Student’s t tests as several groups were examined (eg., Tables 1 and 2). There are few typographic errors in the Abstract: the units for the drugs ranolaxine, veratridine and TTX are all in millimolar concentrations but should be in the micromolar concentrations.Overall, the study is interesting and describes a methodological approach that could help study the late sodium current. The experiments were well designed and presented and the subject of this manuscript is of importance to the field. I have read this submission. I believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard. Competing Interests: No competing interests were disclosed.

Yet a large body of work shows that memory is often surprisingly inaccurate, with errors ranging from misremembering minor details of events to generating illusory memories of entire episodes (Loftus, 1997). False memory, the phenomenon of remembering something that actually never occurred, has become a widely studied topic since its origins in Binet’s (1900) La Suggestibilité and Bartlett’s (1932) Remembering. The pervasiveness of such false memories generates an evolutionary puzzle; in the face of selection pressure for accuracy of memory (Dukas, 1999; Mery, 2013; Raine & Chittka, 2008), how could such systematic failures have persisted over evolutionary time? As with perceptual illusions, false memories might be inevitable by-products of otherwise adaptive cognitive processes. Here we explore whether individuals with a higher propensity to form false memories are better at other cognitive tasks, thus generating a trade-off by which certain cognitive capacities (in this case forming links between distinct memories, as in categorisation) cannot be achieved without the cost of memory inaccuracies.A plethora of experimental paradigms exist for eliciting differing types of false memories in declarative memory, i.e. people’s conscious memory for facts (Brainerd & Reyna, 2005). Episodic (and as such autobiographical) false memories are commonly elicited using the misinformation paradigm, in which information provided or questions asked after an event can bias memory (Loftus, 2005). Conversely, semantic false memories can be elicited using the presentation of lists of semantically related words (Deese, 1959; Roediger & McDermott, 1995). The so called Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm has become widely used for exploring the malleability of memory. In this paradigm, participants begin by studying lists of words; for example a list may comprise the words mad, fear, hate, rage, temper, fury, ire, wrath, happy, fight, hatred, mean, calm, emotion, enrage. Each list is composed of the 15 strongest associates of one critically non-presented word, for example anger for the above list. Upon free recall of the lists or during a recognition test, the non-presented words are ‘remembered’ at high rates and with high levels of confidence. This high proportion of false memories is attributed to the strength of the associations between the words presented in the lists and the words falsely remembered (Deese, 1959).While such tests might be viewed as rather remote from real-life situations in which the accuracy of memory matters, including episodic memories (DePrince et al., 2004; Freyd & Gleaves, 1996), it has recently been proposed that different types of false memories may share, at least in part, the same underlying mechanisms (Otgaar et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2013). Otgaar et al., (2012) showed that children who generate a rich false memory when subjected to a typical false memory implantation paradigm, such as being led to believe they once took a ride in a hot air balloon (which in fact never occurred), are also more susceptible to false memories in a DRM test than children who do not develop a rich implanted false memory. Thus the DRM paradigm, artificial though it may seem, can be a useful laboratory paradigm to test individual false memory susceptibility more generally (but see Ost et al., 2013).False memories, like other memory inaccuracies (such as forgetting) might be by-products of the otherwise adaptive nature of memory processes (Howe et al., 2013; Schacter, 1999; Schacter & Dodson, 2001; Schacter et al., 2011). But what cognitive processes might facilitate the generation of false memories as a by-product? It is possible that our abilities for rule learning, association and categorisation might come at a cost when it comes to memorising isolated facts, events, or indeed words. Specifically with respect to the semantic false memories tested in the DRM paradigm, errors might be produced by the ability of individuals to group words together, placing them in categories based on rules for membership. It therefore seems plausible that the creation of these semantic false memories may be a by-product of our ability to group words into categories.Categorising items is known to generate adaptive benefits such as the ability to learn information more quickly and to show greater efficiency during decision-making (Merritt et al., 2010), but McClelland (1995) argues that whilst such categorisation “is central to our ability to act intelligently” it however “gives rise to distortion as an inherent by-product” (p. 84). It is therefore possible that some memory errors are an inevitable fluke of a powerful, adaptive cognitive phenomenon, in the case of semantic false memories our ability to learn rules and concepts, and to classify novel objects by category memberships (Carey, 2011; Chittka & Jensen, 2011). Indeed, categorisation is a strategy to economise on memory, since it allows recognising objects by a limited set of features that define the category, rather than memorising every single possible member of the category (Avarguès-Weber et al., 2011; Chittka & Niven, 2009; Srinivasan, 2006).One possibility to explore the potential trade-off between categorisation ability and false memory susceptibility is to exploit variation between individuals, and to test whether superior performance on the one test comes with increased error rates on the other. Inter-individual variation is the raw material for evolution, and offers the possibility to quantify the fitness benefits of cognitive traits in natural settings (Cole et al., 2012; Raine & Chittka, 2008; Rowe & Healy, 2014; Thornton et al., 2014) and to test potential trade-offs between one cognitive capacity and another (Boogert et al., 2011; Raine & Chittka, 2012). Here we investigate a potential correlation between an individual’s proneness to semantic type false memories and their categorisation ability. For this purpose we subjected participants to a DRM paradigm to assess their semantic false memory susceptibility and a test consisting of verbal reasoning questions to assess their ability to form categories. Our findings indicate that false memories, to some extent, might be a by-product of our ability to learn rules, categories and concepts.","25 Feb 2015","Approved","Tom Smulders, Centre for Behaviour and Evolution, University of Newcastle, UK","Author Response (Member of the F1000 Faculty) 17 Oct 2014"," The authors dealt appropriately with the comments.

While many nonnative species have little to no measurable impact on their invaded regions, a few have caused great economic and ecosystem harm3,4. The impacts from these few invasive species can affect ecosystem function and thereby reduce the benefits that ecosystems provide for people5–9. In the USA, the cost of invasive species impacts has been estimated at over $120 billion USD per year3,10. One example, the Floating Bell jellyfish, Phyllorhiza punctate, has been estimated to have cost $10 million USD in lost shrimp landings due to clogged nets (reviewed in Williams, S. L. & Grosholz (2008)11). With limited funds to manage and research coastal ecosystems, calculating the value-at-risk (the losses that might accompany the establishment of a high-impact invasive species prior to introduction) for areas not yet invaded may justify the allocation of resources to prevent, mitigate, or further understand invasive impacts12,13.The estimation of value-at-risk from invasive species should be distinguished clearly from a purpose of prediction. Rather than a statement of what is expected to occur, value-at-risk can provide decision-makers with a sense of what might plausibly be lost to invasion without prevention or mitigation. Whereas in finance, value-at-risk is often a monetary quantity subject to loss with a given probability14, the concept might also be useful in settings where data limitations restrict the explicit assignment of probabilities. For example, a decision-maker faced with the decision whether to fund action to prevent biological invasion, or to put in place mechanisms to mitigate losses should invasion occur, might only wish to know what value—in revenues, jobs, etc.—might plausibly be subject to loss, based on our current understanding and its limitations. For such decisions, which are faced everyday, waiting for better data or a more sophisticated model may not be an option. Just as this quantity of value-at-risk can motivate management action, it can also motivate research to improve estimates of value-at-risk, and perhaps even enable prediction.Economic value-at-risk can be seen as a product of two components: ecological (plausible ecological changes that might result from the introduction of a known invader) and economic (the economic costs that might be associated with the above ecological changes or resulting mitigation). Ecological consequences have been assessed mainly as projected post-invasion impacts or pre-invasion estimated ecosystem changes15–17. For example, ecological impact estimates of the European green crab, Carcinus maenas, suggest a future loss of valuable habitats and native species abundance in invaded areas, while larvae of the green crab may also provide food resources to migrating salmon in the northeast Pacific15.The economic consequences of invasive species can be estimated through damages to resources3,4,18. However, many studies that evaluate economic costs do so with considerable simplification of important ecological processes, potentially misrepresenting costs19–21. For example, damages have been measured as reduced fishery values since time of invasion22,23, but these estimates do not consider other potential causal factors or variation in key traits of the native or invading species, such as varying invasion densities, predation rates or varying spatial distribution of native species. Economic valuations can better represent impacts of nonnative species if they incorporate specific information on both the native and invasive populations and their potential interactions20.There are great uncertainties in predicting impacts of species invasions24,25, in part because impacts vary across space and time and are otherwise context-dependent26–30. To be useful, evaluations made before invasions occur should incorporate economic costs and uncertainties associated with the invasion’s possible ecological consequences21,31. If value-at-risk estimates are structured to enable explicit assessment of the uncertainties associated with key parameters, even a coarse understanding of potential impacts can yield useful assessments. Ecological-economic models offer the opportunity to estimate economic changes that include these uncertainties19. Though the value-at-risk of predicted invasions has not frequently been calculated, preemptive management strategies that incorporate ecological modeling could have considerable economic benefits13,19. For example, if early preventative efforts had been funded to prevent invasion of the rusty crayfish, Orconectes rusticus, $6 million USD in fisheries harvest revenue during the 30 years since invasion may have been protected13. These calculations serve a critically important purpose of aligning future research and management25.Here we assessed the value-at-risk for commercial shellfish harvest in nearshore ecosystems of Puget Sound, Washington State, USA, from the green crab C. maenas, a species already regarded as a threat to ecosystems in Puget Sound32,33. To assess value-at-risk, we combined an ecological model of risk to shellfish harvest biomass by C. maenas with an economic model demonstrating risk to current shellfish harvest revenue. The secondary economic effects were predicted using benefit transfer from a similar neighbouring region, British Columbia, Canada (BC). Furthermore, we characterized the extent to which variation in key parameters influenced the resulting value-at-risk.","04 Nov 2014","Approved","Elizabeth Petersen, School of Agricultural and Resources Economics, University of Western Australia, Australia","Reader Comment (Member of the F1000 Faculty) 08 Oct 2014"," The authors have done a thorough job at addressing my comments and I am happy to recommend that the paper be approved for indexing.

However, the degree of difficulty encountered is variable1–4, with the incidence of Difficult Mask Ventilation (DMV) varying from 0.08–15% depending on the criteria used for the definition. The American Society of Anesthesiologists’ (ASA) original definition recognized DMV as a situation where it is not possible for the unassisted anesthesiologist to maintain the oxygen saturation > 90% using 100% oxygen and positive pressure ventilation, or to prevent or reverse signs of inadequate ventilation5. Subsequently, many other definitions have evolved taking into account patient-independent factors that contribute to DMV, such as provider--and equipment-related factors5. Moreover, as an effort to overcome subjective definitions, several grading scales have been proposed, including Adnet’s and Han’s scales1,6.In the face of DMV, critical hypoxemia may rapidly ensue and emphasizes the need for proper identification of risk factors during the preoperative assessment. Obese patients remain one of the most challenging patient populations for airway management7–9, with difficulties arising due to both anatomical features and functional changes10,11. Current protocols for preoperative evaluation focus not only on anatomic characteristics, but also on the identification of systemic features that are associated with airway obstruction and physiologic disarrangements, such as obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA)8,12. For instance, in the general surgical population, a history of OSA has been found to be an independent risk factor of impossible mask ventilation13,14, and patients with a high BMI have a high risk for OSA12. However, despite the known association between DMV, obesity, and OSA, there are no established predictive criteria, nor a simple scoring system which could predict DMV in the obese population.In the present investigation, we primarily aimed to identify specific risk and predictive factors for difficult mask ventilation in obese patients and secondarily we attempted to correlate history and predicted factors related to OSA with DMV. We performed a retrospective analysis based on an existing database14.","07 Nov 2014","Approved","Mirsad Dupanovic, Department of Anesthesiology, University of Kansas, KS, USA","Author Response (Member of the F1000 Faculty) 05 Nov 2014"," I would like to compliment Dr. Cattano and his colleagues for undertaking the investigation on this important topic.

Several protocols for IVND of hPSCs including embryonic stem cells (hESCs) or induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), are used worldwide, resulting in different neuronal types4,5. Upon IVND, confirmation of the neuronal fate is commonly analyzed by the expression of neuron-specific genes, including those of cytoskeletal components (e.g.; TUJ1, MAP2), transcription factors (e.g.; NeuN, NeuroD1) and synaptic proteins (e.g.; synaptotagmin, synaptophysin)6. The expression of these genes indicates that the cell has acquired the machineries needed to build a neuron, but the ultimate indication that these are genuine neurons involves the analysis of their electrical properties. Most studies that do include electrophysiological recordings of hPSCs-derived neurons focus at one specific final time-point along the differentiation cascade, to demonstrate the neuronal identity that is related to the disease in study7–9. However, the analysis of the dynamics of electrical maturation at several time points can provide valuable insights into the pathology of neurodevelopmental disorders. Moreover, in the context of human embryonic neurogenesis, analyzing electrical maturation on hPSCs during IVND can shed light over molecular and cellular mechanisms that so far have been studied only using animal models.Currently, only a few studies on IVND of hPSCs employed electrophysiological recordings at consecutive time points during neural differentiation, so far with inconsistent results, in terms of timing, frequency of action potentials and formation of spontaneous synaptic activity10–13. Although the timing of the development of neuronal electrical properties following IVND is extremely important, it currently remains poorly understood due to high variability in differentiation protocols, culture conditions and hPSC lines used. For this reason, the aim of this study was to systematically analyze, by electrophysiological tools, the developing neurons derived in-vitro from hESCs, in order to define predictive parameters for their electrical maturity, as well as to model the dynamics of neural development.","24 Sep 2014","Approved","Shauna Yuan, Department of Neuroscience, University of California San Diego, CA, USA","Author Response 28 Sep 2014"," This is an interesting article examining the time course of the electrophysiological properties of neurons derived from human embryonic stem cells.  The authors studied firing of action potentials, potassium currents and spontaneous synaptic activities.  They found that all of these properties gradually become more mature over time.  This study shows the feasibility of conducting such experiments to map out developmental stages of neurons in a culture dish.  The title and abstract convey the message of the manuscript.  It is well-written and contains comprehensive information on the study design, methods and analysis.  The data is well presented.  It is not clear from the article that the three properties that the authors looked at are fully developed at 37 days.  Can they comment on the variability between cultures?  In the conclusion, the authors could possibly expand on what they think about the timing of maturation.  Would the days of maturation be very different due to the differentiation method; therefore, such time-course should be performed for each new differentiation protocol?

Impairments in protein degradation lead to the formation of protein aggregates2,3, promote the aging process4,5 and convey the development of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s disease6. There are two major pathways involved in protein degradation: autophagy and degradation by the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS)7. Autophagy is effective in nutrient recycling and protein degradation. During autophagy proteins or whole organelles are engulfed by a double membrane forming autophagosomes that deliver their cargo to the lysosome in animals and the vacuole in plants and fungi8. The UPS consists of a large number of different ubiquitin ligases that act jointly with the proteasome, a multi-protein complex with proteolytic activities. The ubiquitin ligases identify and mark proteins that need to be removed, by formation of a chain of ubiquitin on the target protein9. A ubiquitin chain linked at K-48 is recognized by the 26S proteasome10. The 26S proteasome consists of two subcomplexes, the catalytic 20S core particle and the 19S regulatory particle. The 19S regulatory particle conveys the identification, deubiquitination, unfolding and transport of the substrate into the proteolytic chamber. The core particle is responsible for the degradation of the target proteins. It is composed of four stacked rings, which enclose the proteolytic chamber. The inner rings consist of 7 ß-subunits, including the proteolytic active PRE3 (ß1), PUP1 (ß2) and PRE2 (ß5). The three catalytic subunits are the first substrates of the proteasome. Each contains a prosequence that is removed during assembly of the proteasome by an autocatalytic mechanism11,12. The assembled ß-subunits are framed by rings of seven a-subunits, blocking the entrance to the proteolytic chamber, if no regulatory particle is bound (reviewed in:13).Previous studies revealed that aging reduces the expression of genes coding for proteasome subunits and the activity of the proteasome in several model systems14–16. Also, several studies indicate a health and lifespan prolonging effects of high proteasome activity. For example, the proteasome activity is elevated in human fibroblast cell cultures derived from centenarians14 and in the liver of the naked mole rat17,18, a long-living rodent. Moreover, the overexpression of genes coding for proteasome subunit ß1 or ß5 in human fibroblasts was reported to lead to an increase in overall proteasome abundance and activity, resulting in an increased capacity to cope with stress19. Another component influencing proteasome activity is the proteasome assembly protein UMP1. Saccharomyces cerevisiae overexpressing ScUmp1 shows increased lifespan and viability in response to oxidative stress20. In S. cerevisiae, high levels of proteasome subunit ScRPN4 were reported to increase UPS capacity, enhance resistance to proteotoxic stress and increase replicative lifespan21. Overall, it appears that the proteasome is a relevant target for aging research. The data suggest that keeping protease activity high during aging can lead to an increase in the healthy lifespan of biological systems.We use the filamentous ascomycete Podospora anserina as a model organism to investigate the mechanisms of aging including the role of different quality control pathways (for recent reviews see:22–24). In this study we investigated the impact of protein degradation by the UPS and autophagy. Although we could not demonstrate a role of the UPS, we established that the degradation of GFP-CL1 protein, that was expected to be a target of the proteasome, occurred via autophagy.","29 Dec 2014","Approved with Reservations","Tilman Grune, Department of Nutritional Toxicology, Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena, Germany","Author Response (Member of the F1000 Faculty and F1000Research Advisory Board Member) 16 Jan 2015"," This is an interesting investigation studying proteostasis in Podospora during aging. I am not a specialist in Podospora, but can judge the work on aging and the proteolytic systems.I believe that this paper is lacking one substantial part: this is the measurement of activities of the proteolytic systems. Without this it is hard to draw any conclusion. Major points:In the introduction the authors refer to references reporting “reduced expression of genes for proteasome subunits and the activity of the proteasome” in other aging models. This is true, but the authors should note that the only consistent finding in the literature is a reduced proteasomal activity. Other authors also reported minimal or no changes in proteasomal gene expression, but a reduced activity of the proteasome. Therefore, the measurement of the proteasomal activity is of utmost importance. The conclusion (page 4) that the proteasome has no “role…counteracting adverse effects on cellar proteins” is not supported by the data at all, without activity measurement, inhibition of the proteasome and so on. In Fig.2 the authors refer to “..processed protein” What is this? The number of translation products produced? How can this be concluded, since the authors just study the steady state level? Another statement on page 5: “..proteasomal degradation should result in a total decomposition of GFp-CL1”. In the light of the work of DeMartino/Thomas (Liu et al. 2003), I am not sure, whether this is true under all conditions. The knockout of ATG1 will reduce the macroautophagy process. (Are there alternative pathways in Podospora?) Is in the ATG1 k.o. the proteasome still active? Activities should be measured here, again. The formation of GFP-based aggregates is discussed by the authors. However, also here it is required to show that the proteasomal system is active, since low amounts of protein aggregates might be able to block/inhibit substantial parts of the proteasome.Minor points:In the introduction the authors refer to autophagy as parts of the cell “engulfed by a double membrane”. This is only true for macroautophagy, not for chaperone-mediated autophagy and microautophagy. I do not know, whether these other forms exist in Podospora, but since the authors in their argumentation are jumping in the whole paper from model to model, this should be corrected.

Because the severity of early postoperative pain relates to residual pain after some types of surgery, perioperative pain management can considerably influence the long-term quality of life in patients2,3.Woolf, in 1983, first introduced the theory of preemptive analgesia to attenuate postoperative pain4, confirming the presence of a central factor of post-injury pain hypersensitivity in experimental research. After this, experimental studies showed that various anti-nociceptive methods applied before injuries were more effective in reducing post-injury central sensitization in contrast to administration after injury5.After activation of C-fibers by noxious stimuli, sensory neurons become more sensitive to peripheral inputs, a process called central sensitization6,7. ‘Wind up’8, another mechanism activating spinal sensory neurons, is seen after reiterated stimulation of C-fibers. These sensitizations produce c-fos expression in sensory neurons9, and are related to the activation of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA)7,9 and neurokinin receptors10,11. These genes produce long-lasting changes in the pain-processing system, resulting in hyperexcitation. According to Wall, protection of sensory neurons against central sensitization may provide relief from pain after surgery12. Based on this assumption, preemptive analgesia has been recommended as an effective aid to control postsurgical pain4,13,14. NMDA antagonists have been demonstrated to block the induction of central sensitization and revoke the hypersensitivity once it is established7,15.Ketamine is an old drug that is increasingly being considered for the treatment of acute and chronic pain. Its pharmacology and mechanism of action as an NMDA receptor antagonist are adequately known, but in clinical practice it presents irregular results16. Since ketamine is an NMDA-receptor antagonist, it is supposed to avoid or revoke central sensitization, and thus to attenuate postoperative pain17.This antihyperalgesic action can be achieved by smaller doses than those required for anesthesia. Small-dose ketamine has been specified as not more than 1 mg/kg when given as an iv bolus, and not higher than 20 µg·kg-1·min-1 when given as a constant infusion18,19.Low-doses preemptive ketamine administered iv seem to reduce postoperative pain and/or analgesic consumption15,20,21. According to one study19, a single dose of ketamine 1 mg/kg, when administered in conjunction with local anesthetics, opioids or other anesthetics, provides good postoperative pain control17.Regardless of the overwhelming effectiveness of preemptive ketamine in animal experiments22–24, clinical reports are mixed25–29; some authors have described positive effects30 while others have not31.While early reviews of clinical findings were mostly contradictory26,32, there is still conviction among researchers and clinicians in the effectiveness of preemptive analgesia5.To our knowledge, no prior controlled study has determined the effectiveness of preoperative low-dose iv ketamine as contrasted with placebo in adults after open colon surgery. Thus, this clinical trial was designed to examine the postoperative analgesic effectiveness and opioid-sparing effect of single low-dose iv ketamine in contrast with placebo administered preoperatively.","23 Jan 2015","Approved","Lisa V. Doan, Department of Anesthesiology, NYU School of Medicine, NY, USA",NA," The authors have investigated the role of preoperative ketamine on analgesia in opioid-naive patients undergoing open colon resection. This was a negative study, showing no significant differences in VAS or opioid consumption over the first 24 hours postoperatively. Overall it was a well conducted study. Perhaps the authors could comment on why epidural analgesia was not utilized for open colon resections (though it is unclear whether this would have affected the outcome measures). The dose of ketamine given preoperatively is low. It would be interesting in future studies to use an infusion of ketamine and to include opioid tolerant patients as a study population.

Nucleotides signal through activation of the purinergic P2X and P2Y receptors and can excite or sensitize nociceptive neurons (Burnstock, 2007; Dussor et al., 2009; Sawynok, 2007; Tsuda et al., 2005). The actions of extracellular ATP can be terminated by several membrane-bound and secreted ectonucleotidases that hydrolyze ATP into adenosine (Sowa et al., 2010b; Street et al., 2013; Street et al., 2011; Vongtau et al., 2011; Zimmermann, 2006; Zylka et al., 2008). Adenosine, in turn, can signal through the A1 adenosine receptor (A1R) to inhibit the activity of nociceptive neurons in the spinal cord (Sawynok & Liu, 2003; Zylka, 2011).We previously identified and characterized the ectonucleotidases that hydrolyze AMP in nociceptive neurons (Figure 1). These enzymes are Prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP; (Street et al., 2011; Zylka et al., 2008)), Ecto-5’-nucleotidase (NT5E; (Sowa et al., 2010b; Street et al., 2011)), and Tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP; (Street et al., 2013)). Pharmacological and knockout mouse model studies suggest that each of these enzymes contributes to the production of adenosine from AMP in the dorsal spinal cord, where nociceptive neurons synapse with spinal neurons (Street et al., 2013). Further, knockout mice lacking PAP, NT5E, or both PAP and NT5E showed enhanced nociceptive sensitization in models of chronic pain (Sowa et al., 2010b; Street et al., 2011; Zylka et al., 2008). While NT5E hydrolyzes AMP into adenosine (optimal activity at neutral pH), PAP (at neutral and acidic pHs) and TNAP (at basic pH) can also hydrolyze ATP, ADP, and AMP (Ciancaglini et al., 2010; Sowa et al., 2009; Street et al., 2013; Zimmermann, 2006). Others found that ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases (ENTPDs), an additional class of ectonucleotidases, might also be responsible for hydrolyzing ATP and ADP in primary somatosensory neurons (Vongtau et al., 2011).Figure 1. Ectonucleotidases, their substrates, and products.Several ectonucleotidases, depicted here, have been shown to hydrolyze adenosine-containing extracellular nucleotides such as ATP in a stepwise process into adenosine.In the ENTPD family, four (ENTPD1, -2, -3, and -8) are membrane-bound enzymes that hydrolyze extracellular ATP and ADP (Robson et al., 2006). ENTPD1, -2, and -3 are expressed throughout the central nervous system and display different preferences and kinetics for each nucleotide substrate (Kukulski et al., 2005; Langer et al., 2007). The hydrolysis of ATP by ENTPD1 results in an increase in AMP levels, suggesting ENTPD1 rapidly hydrolyzes ATP and ADP substrates, whereas ENTPD2 preferentially dephosphorylates ATP, resulting in a buildup of extracellular ADP (Figure 1). In contrast, ENTPD3 displays an intermediate activity between ENTPD1 and -2, showing rapid hydrolysis of ATP and transient increases in ADP before conversion into AMP (Kukulski et al., 2005). ENTPD1, -2, and -3 are expressed at similar levels in different cell types of the DRG and spinal cord (Rozisky et al., 2010; Vongtau et al., 2011). Specifically, ENTPD1 is primarily expressed in blood vessels, ENTPD2 is primarily expressed in glial cells, including satellite cells and non-myelinating Schwann cells, and ENTPD3 is preferentially expressed in DRG neurons and their central and peripheral projections (Braun et al., 2004; Vongtau et al., 2011). Further, ENTPD3 co-localizes with markers of nociceptive neurons, such as TRPV1, NT5E, and IB4-binding (Vongtau et al., 2011). These findings suggested that ENTPD3 might contribute to ATP and ADP hydrolysis in nociceptive neurons (Vongtau et al., 2011).To study the contribution of ENTPD3 to ATP and ADP hydrolysis in nociceptive and non-nociceptive neurons in the DRG, we generated a knockout mouse that globally lacked ENTPD3 protein. As part of these studies, we performed immunohistochemical experiments to determine which subsets of DRG neurons expressed ENTPD3 and how loss of ENTPD3 altered nucleotide hydrolysis and nociceptive behaviors. Fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) was used to examine adenosine generation in wild-type (WT) and Entpd3-/- mice. We found no significant differences between WT and Entpd3-/- mice in assays of ectonucleotidase function or in nociceptive behavioral assays, suggesting that additional enzymes are involved in the hydrolysis of ATP and ADP in nociceptive and non-nociceptive neurons.","06 Nov 2014","Approved","Derek Molliver, Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of New England, ME, USA","Author Response 11 Sep 2014"," The authors have effectively addressed several reviewer concerns in the revised manuscript.

Continue reading We thank Dr. Molliver for his comments, particularly given his expertise in studying ENTPD3 in sensory neurons.  As Dr. Molliver notes, we attempted to address this issue of compensation using a number of inhibitors in combination with Entpd3-/- tissues.Drs. Kirley and Molliver raised the question of whether other ectonucleotidases might be upregulated and compensate for the loss of ENTPD3.  We understand the rationale and interest behind this comment.  At this time, we feel such experiments are beyond the scope and focus of our initial study for the following reasons:If we were to find that other ecto-enzymes were upregulated, this information alone would not prove that any upregulated enzymes compensate or act redundantly in the absence of Entpd3. There are numerous ectonucleotidases (NTPDases, NPPs, alkaline phosphatases, acid phosphatases, Na/K-ATPases and likely additional enzymes with ectonucleotidase activity) that could be altered upon Entpd3 deletion.  We thus may miss the most relevant enzyme (or enzymes) if we focus on a candidate list.  Indeed, our attempt to focus on several candidates, via our use of inhibitors, was unsuccessful, suggesting this is a complex issue with multiple enzymes involved.   A genome-wide expression analysis would be more comprehensive but would not provide insights as to which upregulated genes are biologically relevant—knowing what genes change will not allow us to prove they compensate for the loss of Entpd3. Our study was not focused on examining potential compensatory mechanisms in the Enptd3-/- mice.  Such a study will require substantial effort to do properly (i.e. we would first need to identify all the enzymes that are upregulated and then demonstrate, in a systematic manner, that each one does or does not act redundantly using inhibitors and/or double/triple knockout mice).  Such an endeavor would require considerable effort. Thus, in lieu of examining a candidate list of ectonucleotidases, we felt a compromise would be to address this comment as follows (by revising the Conclusions section):“Our use of inhibitors ruled out the possibility that some ENTPDs, alkaline phosphatases and Na/K-ATPase compensated for the loss of ENTPD3.  However, we cannot exclude the possibility that additional known or unknown enzymes with ectonucleotidase activity might be upregulated in Entpd3-/- mice and compensate for the loss of ENTPD3.  Determining which enzymes act redundantly with ENTPD3 will require use of additional inhibitors and additional ectonucleotidase knockout lines.”  Dr Molliver: ""One question that the authors might want to address in the discussion is how to evaluate whether FSCV is capable of resolving neuronal ENTPD3 activity in the dorsal horn when the neurons are surrounded by microglia expressing ENTPD1 (the active site of these enzymes is extracellular). As the authors suggest, further analysis in mice with multiple ENTPD gene deletions may be informative. However, the substantial behavioral evidence indicates that loss of ENTPD3 is not critical for normal sensory processing."" To address this comment, we added the following sentence to the Results & Discussion section:“Note that FSCV cannot resolve neuronal ENTPD3 activity in the dorsal horn from spinal microglial ENTPD1 activity, so the adenosine detected by FSCV after applying ADP could originate from microglial ENTPD1 or other ectonucleotidases in the tissue.  For example, this adenosine could originate from PAP and/or TNAP, as these enzymes are located in the same region and can also hydrolyze ADP to adenosine (Figure 1).” We thank Dr. Molliver for his comments, particularly given his expertise in studying ENTPD3 in sensory neurons.  As Dr. Molliver notes, we attempted to address this issue of compensation using a number of inhibitors in combination with Entpd3-/- tissues.Drs. Kirley and Molliver raised the question of whether other ectonucleotidases might be upregulated and compensate for the loss of ENTPD3.  We understand the rationale and interest behind this comment.  At this time, we feel such experiments are beyond the scope and focus of our initial study for the following reasons:If we were to find that other ecto-enzymes were upregulated, this information alone would not prove that any upregulated enzymes compensate or act redundantly in the absence of Entpd3. There are numerous ectonucleotidases (NTPDases, NPPs, alkaline phosphatases, acid phosphatases, Na/K-ATPases and likely additional enzymes with ectonucleotidase activity) that could be altered upon Entpd3 deletion.  We thus may miss the most relevant enzyme (or enzymes) if we focus on a candidate list.  Indeed, our attempt to focus on several candidates, via our use of inhibitors, was unsuccessful, suggesting this is a complex issue with multiple enzymes involved.   A genome-wide expression analysis would be more comprehensive but would not provide insights as to which upregulated genes are biologically relevant—knowing what genes change will not allow us to prove they compensate for the loss of Entpd3. Our study was not focused on examining potential compensatory mechanisms in the Enptd3-/- mice.  Such a study will require substantial effort to do properly (i.e. we would first need to identify all the enzymes that are upregulated and then demonstrate, in a systematic manner, that each one does or does not act redundantly using inhibitors and/or double/triple knockout mice).  Such an endeavor would require considerable effort. Thus, in lieu of examining a candidate list of ectonucleotidases, we felt a compromise would be to address this comment as follows (by revising the Conclusions section):“Our use of inhibitors ruled out the possibility that some ENTPDs, alkaline phosphatases and Na/K-ATPase compensated for the loss of ENTPD3.  However, we cannot exclude the possibility that additional known or unknown enzymes with ectonucleotidase activity might be upregulated in Entpd3-/- mice and compensate for the loss of ENTPD3.  Determining which enzymes act redundantly with ENTPD3 will require use of additional inhibitors and additional ectonucleotidase knockout lines.”  Dr Molliver: ""One question that the authors might want to address in the discussion is how to evaluate whether FSCV is capable of resolving neuronal ENTPD3 activity in the dorsal horn when the neurons are surrounded by microglia expressing ENTPD1 (the active site of these enzymes is extracellular). As the authors suggest, further analysis in mice with multiple ENTPD gene deletions may be informative. However, the substantial behavioral evidence indicates that loss of ENTPD3 is not critical for normal sensory processing."" To address this comment, we added the following sentence to the Results & Discussion section:“Note that FSCV cannot resolve neuronal ENTPD3 activity in the dorsal horn from spinal microglial ENTPD1 activity, so the adenosine detected by FSCV after applying ADP could originate from microglial ENTPD1 or other ectonucleotidases in the tissue.  For example, this adenosine could originate from PAP and/or TNAP, as these enzymes are located in the same region and can also hydrolyze ADP to adenosine (Figure 1).” Competing Interests: None.

Mechanisms that regulate guanaco populations (Lama guanicoe) are poorly known; this species was heavily exploited in the Patagonian steppe, and its numbers and distribution have diminished significantly during the last century because of grazing conflicts with a sheep-based society, and overhunting (the guanaco’s historical distribution has been reduced by 75% in Chile and Peru, and by 60% in Argentina)1. The guanaco is in the Least Concern IUCN Red List category (http://www.iucnredlist.org/, downloaded on 11 September 2013) but it has been included in Appendix II of CITES 2013 (http://www.cites.org/eng/app/2013/E-Appendices-2013-06-12.pdf).No population of any species can grow indefinitely, and population checks based upon different processes restrict population size and/or geographic distribution; these processes are either density-stabilizing or density-limiting2. The former are of a biotic nature and depend on the interaction between individuals of the same or different species, while the latter are independent of population size. Stabilization results from density-dependence, with a regulatory effect that varies in intensity with the size or density of the population itself, however, not all density-dependent factors are density-stabilizing. The density-limiting factors can also be considered density-responsive because the per capita amount or availability of resources decreases as the population density increases. Thus, these two types of factors (density-stabilizing and density-limiting) rarely act independently: the density-limiting factors (generally of a physical and/or climatic nature), may determine the level at which populations become stabilized by the density-dependent processes, but they do not have a stabilizing capacity per se; for this reason many wildlife population dynamic and management models include the effects of climatic variables (e.g., Dennis & Otten, 2000; Colchero et al., 2009)3,4.The guanaco is one of the two extant wild South American camelids, and ranges from Northern Peru through Chile, and across Patagonia to southern Argentina and Chile, reaching Tierra del Fuego. It is found from sea level to nearly 4500 m on the Andes mountain range, and occupies a wide variety of habitats from hardpan deserts to scrublands to grasslands5.Although there are several studies on the population regulation processes in mammals in general6,7, and in ungulates in particular8,11, there are very few studies in wild South American camelids that analyze population growth regulation. There are several studies dealing with population dynamics of vicuña (Vicugna vicugna)12–14 and guanacos15–17; however none of them considered the effect of density, livestock and climate on population growth rate.Thus, our purpose in this work was to test the hypothesis that population density, sheep stock, and climatic variables, affect the growth rate of the guanaco population from the island of Tierra del Fuego, Chile.","21 Aug 2014","Approved","Pablo Acebes, Department of Ecology, Autonomous University of Madrid, Spain","Author Response 14 May 2014"," The authors have improved the ms from their first submitted version. Please see the comments below to further improve the article:First paragraph (introduction): please put guanaco in the singular. Guanaco population sampling section: please replace ‘SIG’ with ‘GIS’. Guanaco population sampling section: please remove ‘surface’ in “A is the total study area surface”. Results: part of the results is a justification of the analyses carried out and should be placed in Material and Methods. Discussion: in my view one of the most important results is the absence of negative effects of sheep on guanaco population growth rate that indeed has been cited as one of the major drivers of guanaco population decline particularly in Patagonia in the 20 century. For that reason I think authors should discuss this important result more deeply. I have read this submission.

The authors should explain more in detail, for example, which are the differences between the density-stabilizing and the density-limiting processes, or the evidence of including climatic variables when modelling population growth rate trends.""After the following paragraph that was already in the original text:“No population of any species can grow indefinitely, and population checks based upon different processes restrict population size and/or geographic distribution; these processes are either density-stabilizing or density-limiting”We added the following paragraph explaining the differences between the density-stabilizing and the density-limiting processes.“The former are of a biotic nature and depends on the interaction between individuals of the same or different species, while the latter are independent of population size.

Without any justification, authors could have also included others variables in the models, as climatic variables do not account for the pattern described, but this doesn’t necessarily mean that climate hasn’t got any effect on the guanaco population growth rate. Moreover authors should explain if these two climatic variables are selected as indicators of primary production and harsh weather conditions.""To explain and justify the use of these climatic variables the paragraph below was incorporated in the section “Climatic variables”:“These climatic variables were selected because some studies suggested that they have influence on guanaco demographic parameters: Rey et al. 201226 observed that after a severe drought the proportion guanaco yearlings/female decreased significantly, and Sarno et al. 199917 detected a negative effect of winter snowfall on guanaco juvenile survival; because we had insufficient snowfall data we used the winter temperature as a proxy for winter snowfall.” ""As authors stated in introduction, guanaco populations have undergone overhunting (poaching) and competition with sheep, these being two of the major forces of their dramatic decline in the last century.  For that reason, it is quite surprising that no variables related to livestock were included in the modelling procedure. The population has increased a lot in the studied period (x8) and just climate and/or density-dependent process do not explain alone such increase in my view. Therefore authors should consider including livestock effects, its influence on resource availability along the studied period and the mentioned overhunting, as this could really explain the detected trend.""In relation with the “poaching” the following paragraph was incorporated in section “Study area” to justify why this variable was not considered in our study:“In contrast to the continent, the puma (Puma concolor), the main predator of guanacos, is absent in the island; since 1977 the guanaco hunting has been controlled by Chilean National Forest Corporation (CONAF, according to its Spanish acronym) and the Chilean Agricultural and Livestock Service (SAG, according to its Spanish acronym).”<U+200B>In relation to the suggestion to incorporate livestock in the analysis, we re-analyzed our multiple regression incorporating the variable livestock as sheep population. We re-processed the regressions incorporating the sheep population as a new independent variable as a possible predictor of the guanaco population growth rate (l); so our new analysis increased from 5 to 6 independent variables: sheep population, guanaco population size, winter temperature, winter temperature with a lag of 1 year, annual precipitation, annual precipitation with a lag of 3 years. Our main results didn’t change and it was confirmed that only the guanaco population size seems to have an effect on the population growth rate (l). These changes can be found in the “Methods” and in the “Results” sections. “The guanaco sampling method has changed during the studied period (different band widths). Besides, were the transects chosen based on the topography and vegetation cover of the ranch to ensure that all areas were visible to census-takers along their transects? I am not sure if that could be a source of error, but authors should discuss this point.” In the Section “Guanaco population sampling” we added the following paragraphs where we explain the motive of the change and justify the transects chosen: “The sampling methodology was changed by an expert recommendation made in 1995 23; as in year 2000 the fixed and the undefined band width methods were applied simultaneously, we tested both results and found no significant statistical difference between them.”“Despite randomly selected transects are recommended24, preexisting roads were used because according to Soto (2010)18 the existing system of roads is an adequate sample of the area.” “Moreover, I recommend authors to re-analyze their data using the DISTANCE program (Buckland et al., 2004) to estimate population size over the period, as the analyses performed by this package seems much more robust that the one employed by authors. If they do so, authors could also include topographic variables in the models to see whether the resulting models change. The reason is that the authors do not explain if guanacos occur in both biomes (steppe and forest), because if that was true, detection of guanacos was completely different in both ecosystems. Therefore the band width of 500 or 1000m is not valid for forests.” In the Section “Guanaco population sampling” the following paragraphs was incorporated to justify the methodology used:“Raedeke (1978) 19 claims that the Leopold method is valid when the following conditions are satisfied: (1) the road systems must be an adequate sampling of the study area, (2) the network road must be randomly distributed, and (3) the animals included in the sampling must be randomly distributed in relation to the observer’s route; and he considers that in the south of the Tierra del Fuego Island these assumptions are fulfilled. Soto 201018 compared population estimations by the Leopold and Distance methods and found that the value of the means estimate by Leopold methods fall within the confidence intervals estimated by Distance; additionally, as all sampling periods used the same methodology whatever bias might exist in the estimation of the mean abundance using the Leopold method, the relative changes among years (and thus the temporal trend) will be adequately represented; thus, we conclude that the Leopold’s method seems adequate for our purposes18.”In relation to the forest and the sampling methodology, as the area occupied by forests is low and it has some degree of intervention, the visibility of the guanaco is adequate, hence we considered that the forest is a minor component and that does not affect the efficiency of the sampling procedure. In the section “Study area” the next paragraph was incorporated:“The forested area is about 8.8% of the total study area, with different degrees of forest clearance that offers adequate visibility for guanaco sampling.” “Regarding the population size estimated along the 36 years (Supplementary table), important (huge) differences are found, for example between 2004 and 2005 or between 2006 and 2007, or between 2007 and 2008. My concern is if such “jumps” could be related to the census surveyed. Please discuss this point.”In the “Discussion” section we added the following discussion as required by the reviewer:“The results of the guanaco population sampling suggest a certain trend in the population size, with a sort of exponential growth in the first few years, becoming more variable as the population grows, with more marked fluctuations during the last 10-12 years; this may imply that the population is becoming stabilized, possibly approaching its carrying capacity. On the other hand, the sampling results of those last 10-12 years show abrupt “jumps” in some years (for example 2004-2005) that may be the consequence of the mobility of guanacos from the Cameron ranch to neighboring sites and vice versa; since the transect sampling does not identify individuals the effects of possible local displacements could not be considered.” “The authors used a stepwise regression when other approaches such as logistic regressions, Ricker or Beverton-Holt models could give more suitable results. Please explain or justify your decision.”Our goal was to carry out a preliminary analysis that would guide us in the study of the population regulation process in the guanaco. As there are studies in ungulate that have used simple multiple regression analysis and obtained good/satisfactory results, we considered that it was of interest to test this technique as a first step in such an analysis.In the manuscript the following paragraph was incorporated in the “Discussion” section to justify our decision: ""Contrary to what was expected based on the bibliography of ungulate’s population dynamics, weather variables do not seem to influence the density-dependent population growth rate process of the guanaco population of the Cameron ranch. Our aim was to carry out a preliminary analysis that would help identify some of the regulation processes in guanaco population; so we used a simple multiple regression analysis as a first step in that direction; nevertheless, our conclusion is that in order to test the effects of climatic variables  on population regulation of large ungulates as the guanaco, the use of a population dynamic model would be recommended, for they seem to account better  for the interaction between density-dependent processes and weather variables than a simple regression between the latter and guanaco population growth rate.” “The selection of the best model among the candidates should be done by Akaike’s information”This suggestion was considered and the respective Akaike’s values were calculated. Minor comments:“Refer to climatic variables or climatic effects, instead of climatic covariables.”The recommendation was applied. “Explain more in detail Corani & Gatto’s studies.”With the previous changes we realize that the citation of Corani and Gatto (2007) is not necessary any more.

A number of genetic and immune studies indicate dysregulated immune responses as contributors to the pathogenesis of MS1–7. Genetic analyses show an association of MS with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class II human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DRB-1 and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to immune function1,2,8. Both Th1/Th17 CD4+ T-lymphocytes and immunoglobulins appear to have a causative role1,2,9. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses to myelin and non-myelin targets have differentiated some MS patients from healthy controls9–11. Non-myelin antigens that are targets for immunoglobulins isolated from MS patients include neurofilaments, axonal neurofascin and RNA binding proteins, including heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1)9,12–16.Recently, mutations in RNA binding proteins have been shown to cause neurological disease17–21. For example, a mutation (p.D263V) in the prion-like domain (PrLD) of hnRNP A1 has been shown to cause familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)22. In addition to inherited mutations, somatic variants have also been shown to cause neurological disease23. hnRNP A1 performs a number of critical cellular functions related to transcription, nucleocytoplasmic transport of mRNA and translation24,25. In addition to the PrLD, other important functional domains in hnRNP A1 include two RNA binding domains (RBDs) and M9, its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling domain22. M9 binds its nuclear receptor, transportin-1 (TPNO-1, also known as karyopherin ß2) and the hnRNP A1:TPNO-1 complex is transported into and out of the nucleus3,9,16,26,27.Our lab has performed extensive studies on the role of autoimmunity to hnRNP A1 in MS and human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), a viral-induced model and clinical mimic of MS3,28–30. Initially, we discovered that HAM/TSP patients develop antibodies to hnRNP A1 that cross-react with HTLV-1-tax, indicative of molecular mimicry29,31. Next, the epitope of the HAM/TSP IgG response (AA293-304) was localized to M9 (AA268-305)32. M9 is a bipartite phenylalanine-tyrosine nuclear localization sequence (PY-NLS) that requires binding to TPNO-1 for hnRNP A1 to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm16,31 Because of the similarities between MS and HAM/TSP, we hypothesized that MS patients would also develop antibodies to hnRNP A1. In fact, antibodies isolated from MS patients, in contrast to healthy controls and Alzheimer’s patients, were also found to immunoreact with the identical hnRNP-A1-M9 epitope (AA293-304)16. Subsequent studies indicated that the IgG was biologically active and potentially pathogenic. For example, mono-specific antibodies to hnRNP A1 isolated from patients caused decreased neuronal firing using neuronal patch clamp in rat brain sections31,33. Further, neurons exposed to anti-hnRNP A1-M9293-304 specific antibodies resulted in neurodegeneration and neuronal death16,34. The anti-hnRNP A1-M9293-304 specific antibodies also caused changes in neuronal RNA expression that correlate with the clinical phenotype of MS and HAM/TSP patients (ie. spastic paraparesis), which was subsequently confirmed in neurons isolated from the brains of MS patients16. Additional studies showed that anti-hnRNP A1-M9293-304 specific antibodies entered neurons via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and caused apoptosis in a neuronal cell line34. Anti-hnRNP A1-M9293-304 specific antibodies also caused a redistribution of hnRNP A1 in neurons from nuclear to an equal distribution of nuclear and cytoplasmic localization, suggesting the antibodies interfered with M9, which is required for hnRNP A1s nuclear import34. Considering: (1) the role of hnRNP A1 in cellular function; (2) variant forms of hnRNP A1 cause neurodegenerative disease, and (3) hnRNP A1 is an autoimmune target in MS patients, we hypothesized that MS patients would contain novel genomic DNA single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in hnRNP A1-M9, which when expressed, would alter cellular function and contribute to cell death.","03 Oct 2014","Approved","Hans Lassmann, Department Neuroimmunology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria","Author Response 11 Sep 2014"," I have no further comments.

Methods that predict putative structures from sequences are based either on features from databases of known structures (template-based methods)2–4 or use first principles of atomic interactions (ab initio or de novo methods)5–7. Typically, these methods yield multiple, closely-ranked possibilities. Model quality assessment programs (MQAP) that validate accuracy of these predicted structures are used to select the best candidate from the set of predicted structures.MQAPs can be classified as energy, consensus or knowledge based. Two major sources of errors in energy based methods used for refining or discriminating protein structures are inaccuracies in the force field due to the inherent approximations in equations that model multi-atomic configurations, and inadequate sampling of the conformational space8–12. Consensus based methods are based on the principle that structural features that are frequently observed in a population of structures are more likely to be present in the native structure13–16. These clustering methods outperform other MQAP methods14 and are “very useful for structural meta-predictors17”. However, they are prone to be computationally intensive due structure-to-structure comparison of all models16, and are of limited use when the number of possible structures is small18. Knowledge based methods proceed by deriving an empirical potential (also known as statistical potential) from the frequency of residue contacts in the known structures of native proteins19,20. For a system in thermodynamic equilibrium, statistical physics hypothesizes that the accessible states are populated with a frequency which depends on the free energy of the state and is given by the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann hypothesis states that if the database of known native protein structures is assumed to be a statistical system in thermodynamic equilibrium, specific structural features would be populated based on the free energy of the protein conformational state. Applying a converse logic, Sippl reasoned that the frequencies of occurrence of structural features such as interatomic distances in the database of known protein structures could be used to assign a free energy (potential of mean force) for a given protein conformation21,22. Furthermore, this statistical potential can be used to discriminate the native structure23–27. The proper characterization of the reference state is a critical aspect in applying statistical potentials23. In spite of their popularity, the application of such empirical energy functions to predict and assess protein structures are vigorously debated28,29. Many MQAP programs perform better when multiple statistical metrics are combined30–33. The paramount importance of obtaining high quality protein structures from sequences using in silico methods can be estimated by the effort invested by researchers every two years34 to evaluate both structure prediction tools35 and MQAPs17,34,36.Here, we propose a novel statistical potential to assess the quality of protein structures based on the electrostatic potential difference (EPD) of Cß atoms in consecutive residues - EPD profile of sidechain atoms used in assessment of protein structures (ESCAPIST). Previously, we have established that the EPD is conserved in cognate pairs of active site residues in proteins with the same function37–40. The ability of finite difference methods to quickly obtain consistent electrostatic properties from peptide structures provides an invaluable tool for investigating other innate properties of protein structures41. We plot the EPD profiles for different atom types (Ca atoms, Cß atoms and the C-N bond) in consecutive residues from a set of non-homologous protein structures obtained from the PISCES database (http://dunbrack.fccc.edu/PISCES.php)42. We proceed to show that the EPD between Cß atoms in consecutive residues can be used to generate a scoring function that assesses the quality of protein structures. This EPD scoring function is then applied to standard decoy sets from the Decoys ‘R’ Us database (http://dd.compbio.washington.edu) to establish the validity of our method43.","18 Jul 2014","Approved","Patricia C Weber, Imiplex LLC, USA","Author Response 15 Sep 2014"," The quality of protein structure models is assessed by the geometry of adjacent C beta atoms.

During embryonic development, the upper and lower jaws derive from the maxillary and mandibular processes of the first pharyngeal arch (PA1). Most cartilaginous and dermatocranial derivatives of PA1 are formed by Cranial Neural Crest Cells (CNCCs)4–9. During migration, signals emanating from the endoderm and possibly other PA1 components instruct the CNCCs to unfold the morphogenetic process of the jaws8,10,11. The nested expression of Dlx homeobox genes, vertebrate homologues of Drosophila Distal-less, has a fundamental role in the specification of the dorsoventral patterning of PA1 derivatives2,12. While Dlx1 and Dlx2 are expressed by CNCCs of the maxillary and mandibular components of PA1, Dlx5 and Dlx6 transcripts are present only in mandibular CNCCs. Targeted simultaneous inactivation of Dlx5 and Dlx613,14 results in the transformation of lower jaw into upper jaw-like structures, underlining the importance of these genes for lower jaw identity. This phenotype is more severe than those observed in both single mutants (for instance, see2,13,15,16). The activation of Dlx5 and Dlx6 by endothelin-1 signalling is necessary and sufficient to define lower jaw identity17–21. Interestingly it has been observed13,14 that, after inactivation of Dlx5 and Dlx6, maxillary components are also affected despite the fact that these genes are not expressed by maxillary CNCCs. This observation could be accounted for by the presence of shared Dlx5/6-dependent signalling centres in proximity to the extremities of both the mandibular and maxillary arches; this notion gave rise to the so-called “Hinge and Caps” model of jaw organization1,3,22. In its original formulation this model predicts the presence of two opposing morphogen gradients, one emanating from the region of the upper/lower jaw articulation (hinge) and one from the distal extremities of PA1 (caps); the origin and nature of these signals remain elusive. Here we revisit the effects of Dlx5 and Dlx6 double inactivation on jaw development and, using a transgenic lineage tracing approach, we reveal that the maxillary arch epithelium harbours a cellular contingent derived from frontonasal Dlx5-expressing progenitors. Our findings suggest that transient Dlx5/6 expression could program these epithelial cells to provide the cues needed for maxillary arch morphogenesis.","03 Oct 2014","Approved","Robert Knight, Craniofacial Development and Stem Cell Biology, King's College London, Guy's Hospital, UK","Author Response 10 Sep 2014"," All of my questions and requests have been satisfied and I recommend indexation with no further modifications.This is an interesting story and it is intriguing that Dlx genes function in different cellular compartments to pattern the upper and lower jaws, especially considering our assumptions about the homology of upper and lower skeletal elements in the pharyngeal arches.

Continue reading “The authors display 3D reconstructions emphasising the symmetry of the transformed skeletal elements, but do not elaborate beyond the characterisations of these mutants that haven previously been performed.” As discussed in our first revision in response to Referee 1, in this manuscript we have focused our attention on the simultaneous alteration of both upper and lower jaws of Dlx5/6 double mutant embryos. In previous reports, the skeletal analysis was interpreted suggesting that the lower jaw was transformed into an upper jaw with gain of symmetry. Now we stress the fact that the acquisition of new symmetry derives from morphological changes occurring both in upper and lower jaws. “The lineage tracing experiments are elegant and could be elaborated on to show if the restriction of the Dlx5 lineage cells are restricted to the ectoderm throughout the maxillary arch, as only one plane is shown in Figure 3.”  As stated in the revised version of the paper we have analysed complete sets of serially sectioned embryos and we conclude that Dlx5 lineage derivatives are restricted to the ectoderm in each section analysed. We have now added the sentence: “the analysis of the complete set of serial sections” to stress this point. The specific section shown in Fig. 3 was chosen as it shows simultaneously the maxillary and the mandibular arches. “One thing that I was not able to glean from this work, is whether there is any Dlx6 expression or Dlx6-derived cells in the maxillary arch and if so, is this in ectoderm-derived or CNCC-derived cells?” and … “The authors further state that these cells no longer express Dlx5 when they arrive at this point, but again this is not shown, but rather referenced by other work.” In situ hybridization and transcriptomic analyses by our group as well as others has, to our opinion, settled the issue (eg: Ozeki et al., 2004; Charité et al,, 2001; Jeong et al., 2008). Maxillary cells, at any time analysed, do not express Dlx6, this does not rule out a transient and early Dlx6 expression in maxillary-fated cells in the nasal prominence. We have added a paragraph at the end of the discussion to emphasize this issue, including the sentence: ‘As the compound Dlx5/6 mutant displays an upper jaw malformation which is not observed in either single mutant (Jeong et al., 2008), it appears that Dlx5 and Dlx6 exert redundant functions not only on lower, but also on upper jaw morphogenesis.

During influenza season, 20 to 30% of stem cell transplant SCT recipients with respiratory symptoms can test positive for Influenza with a mortality rate of up to 28%1. Non-transplant cancer patients can also have a high mortality rate of up to 38%2, being higher in patients with lung, hematological and colorectal cancer, in patients that develop lower respiratory tract infections, and in patients with other co-morbid conditions. In Argentina, seasonal Influenza in onco-hematological patients is associated to a 12% incidence of pneumonia and to a 5% of 30-day mortality3.In March 2009 a novel Influenza A virus, later known as 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1), emerged in Mexico. The new strain initially spread among travelers to the USA and Canada, and subsequently infected people worldwide4. Clinical presentations ranged from mild symptoms to severe cases that lead to pneumonia and respiratory failure–related deaths.The first cases of pandemic Influenza A (H1N1) in Argentina were reported in May 2009, in travelers returning from Mexico and the USA. From May to December 2009 there were 11931 cases of confirmed Influenza A H1N1 in Argentina, 617 deaths, and over 90% of the circulating respiratory viruses in adults were the novel Influenza A H1N15.Data from different studies on the impact of this new virus in the adult cancer and SCT population are somewhat contradictory. Many studies from different countries were reported1,6–16. In these studies, the incidence of pneumonia ranges from 2011 to 52%8, while the reported mortality rate ranges from 0–10%6,11,12,14,16 to as high as 21–31%7–10,15.During the 2013 winter season, pandemic Influenza A H1N1 continued to circulate (FluNetDB, WHO, http://apps.who.int/globalatlas/dataQuery/default.asp).In this study, we examined the effects and severity of pandemic H1N1 Influenza during the 2009 influenza season, in patients with cancer and SCT in two cities of Argentina.","17 Nov 2014","Approved","Pablo Bonvehí, Infectious Disease Section, Centro de Educación Médica e Investigaciones Clínicas Norberto Quirno (CEMIC), Argentina","Author Response (Member of the F1000 Faculty) 08 Dec 2014"," This is an interesting article that shows the impact of pandemic 2009 influenza A (H1N1) in a highly vulnerable population for influenza complications such as immunocompromised oncohaematological patients.The paper is well written and I would like to make some comments or questions to the authors:Did you observe any difference in time elapsed since the initiation of symptoms between those with community acquired pandemic 2009 influenza A (H1N1) who presented with upper respiratory tract infections and those who presented with pneumonia?  Previous vaccination against seasonal influenza showed that some degree of preexisting immunity to pandemic 2009 influenza A (H1N1) strains exists, especially among adults aged >60 years.

Gene duplication provides natural selection with the underlying mechanism to add functionality and adaptability to the genome by reusing pre-existing efficient and stable protein folds to catalyze novel reactions1. The fate of duplicated genes - unchanged functionality, pseudogenization, subfunctionalization or neofunctionalization - is the focus of intense research enabled by the advancements in sequencing technologies2,3. Differing opinions on function innovation have also been articulated4, and substantiated with real time evolution experiments5.Gene duplication plays a key role in the evolution of virulence-associated genes6. Secreted lipases, one of the highly replicated genes in Candida albicans7, has been implicated in disease pathogenesis, both in humans8 and in plants9. A lipase/esterase (LipA) from X. oryzae (Xanthomonas orysae pv. oryzaeraises (Xoo)) that causes bacterial blight in rice and is conserved across the genus Xanthomonas, has been recently characterized10. LipA also has three homologs (LesA, LesB and LesC) in the Xylella fastidiosa (Xf) genome11.Xf is a major source of concern for both economic12 and food security reasons13, being the causal agent for Pierce’s disease of grape (PD) and citrus variegated chlorosis (CVC) of citrus species14. The presence of three duplicated genes (LesA/B/C) closely related to LipA from X. oryzae raises certain intriguing questions. It is logical to assume that these genes serve different purposes, since it is unlikely that three genes with identical functions will be maintained in the genome. A deeper understanding of their respective roles in the phenotypic context is essential in order to develop novel strategies to counter their threat15–17. LesA and LesB have 93% identity - yet, LesA can hydrolyze tributyrin whereas LesB can not. In the current work, we aim to induce tributyrin hydrolysis in LesB using minimal mutations.The desire to mimic and accelerate natural evolution has fueled interest in directed evolution experiments, which endow or enhance functionality in enzymes. There has been some pioneering work in applying de novo methods to obtain catalytic functions18–22. However, most methods start with a template protein having the desired activity, known active site residues and 3D structure23–25. Previously, we have established a computational method (CLASP) based on spatial and electrostatic properties for the detection of active sites26–29, and a methodology to quantify promiscuity in proteins30. We also explored the prospect of promiscuous active sites to serve as the starting point for directed evolution (DECAAF)31,32. DECAAF has been applied to the problem of identifying mutations in LesB based on the active site of LesA in order to endow LesB with tributyrin hydrolysis.Since the structures of LesA/B are not known, and they share significant sequence homology with LipA (whose structure is known: PDBid:3H2G10), we used RaptorX to model the LesA/B structures. We first verified that the electrostatic profile of LesA and LesB are different. The LesA and LesB structures were then superimposed, and residues within a radii of 6 Å (MUT1:three residues) and 8 Å (MUT2:eight residues, including the three residues in MUT1) from the residues of the catalytic triad in LesA were compared to those in LesB. The differing residues were identified as the set of mutations which would induce tributyrin hydrolysis in LesB. It was observed that MUT1 and MUT2 residues are in two different contiguous stretches in the protein. As a validation step, we modeled the mutated sequences of LesB using RaptorX, and analyzed the differences in their electrostatic profiles. We created two mutants for LesB: LesBMUT1 with three mutations, and LesBMUT2 with eight mutations. The mutations in LesBMUT1 replicated the electrostatic congruence in the MUT1 residues, but not in the MUT2 residues. Consequently, we expected LesBMUT2 to have tributyrin hydrolysis, but not LesBMUT1.We tested for the activity of LesB wild type and LesBMUT1/LesBMUT2 proteins using two assays. In one we use agar plates containing emulsified tributyrin, which upon hydrolysis of tributyrin to glycerol and butyric acid makes a clear zone visible. The other assay is a fluorescent quantitative assay in which 4-methylumbelliferyl butyrate (4-MUB) is used as a fluorescent substrate. The tributyrin hydrolysis activity of wild type LesB and LesBMUT1/LesBMUT2 with suggested mutations was tested in vitro using heterologous expression of these proteins in E. coli. We were able to confirm the tributyrin hydrolysis activity of LesBMUT2 in vitro using the assays mentioned above, while LesBMUT1 showed no activity.","16 Feb 2015","Approved","Tomomichi Fujita, Faculty of Science, Hokkaido University, Japan",NA," In this article, the authors clearly demonstrate usefulness of their in silico methods to identify residues which are spatially equivalent but electrostatically different in cognate pairs in protein family, then provide in vivo validation of the method by measuring the enzymatic activity of the designed protein. Such “focused mutation” approach and the experimental validation allow us to identify minimal mutations, which are important for the enzymatic activity and also may shed light on the fate of, for example, the duplicated gene products; pseudogenization, subfunctionalization or neofunctionalization.Minor comments for improvement of article.The authors aimed to induce tributyrin hydrolysis in LesB using minimal mutations. They described either three (MUT1) or eight mutations (MUT2) in LesB protein, where MUT1 did not show tributyrin hydrolysis activity, but MUT2 did. However, I wonder if the number of mutations, eight could be minimal mutations or not. If the authors have other mutations introduced, such as between four and seven mutations in LesB, please explain them. In Fig. 1(a), amino acid positions are numbered, however, to which protein are the numbers? Also, please mark three active site residues of LipA (serine catalytic triad) in the figure. In Fig. 2(c), please indicate five amino acid residues (G363, E364, F366, F367 and T368) in another contiguous stretch. Also, please show the catalytic triad as well. In Table 1, please indicate to which amino acid residues “a, b, c, d” of active site atoms correspond, respectively. In Table 1, I don’t understand amino acid positions, SER164, HIS364, and SER74 in LesBMUT1, which are different from the positions, SER165, HIS365, and ARG/SER75 in LesB/LesBMUT1, respectively. In text, page 5, a right column, line 18 from bottom, “…(LesBMUT1/LesBMUT2) modulate this EPD back to moderately positive again (+12.4 EPD units).” would be “…(LesBMUT1/LesBMUT2) modulate this EPD back to moderately positive again (+19.3 and +12.4 EPD units, respectively).” In text, page 6, a left column, it would be better to show the results of LesBMUT1, showing no hydrolysis activity in Fig. 3(a), (b). If the authors have the data of LesA, please show them together in Fig. 3(a), (b). In Fig. 3(a), LesBMUT1 should be LesBMUT2. In Fig. 3(b) and in Materials and methods, please explain what LesB4 is. In Table 3, whereas the EPD in the pair ‘ad’ of LESA and LESBMUT1 are negative, the EPD in the one of LESBMUT2 is positive (+5.4), showing inconsistency of the presence of the enzymatic activity in LESA and in LESBMUT2, but not in LESBMUT1. Please explain this. In Materials and methods, cell culture and protein extraction, the extracted protein was quantified and used for the 4-MUB assay. Please describe how the authors normalized protein concentration in each sample to calculate mean and standard deviation values for the 4-MUB assay. In Materials and methods, a right column, line 14, what does ‘the position p’ mean, which is described as in “the alignment for the position p”?

They belong to a single order (Halobacteriales), which consists of a single family (Halobacteriaceae), making them genetically similar to each other1. Many haloarchaea are facultative aerobes as extreme saline environments often have low oxygen solubility2. Haloarchaea have adapted to survive in their saline environments by employing a tactic called “salting in” whereby they selectively uptake K+ and Cl- ions to a concentration of greater than three molar. To keep their proteins from precipitating in these high ionic strength conditions, haloarchaea have also adapted a primarily acidic proteome with proteins containing most of their negative charges on their surface3. The negative charges on the surface help orient water molecules to keep the proteins hydrated thereby stopping the possibility of precipitation.Although saline environments are often studied in relation to salt content, they have been shown to have other extreme conditions: temperature, gamma radiation, oxygen sensitivity, UV, and pH, which all affect the adaptation and survival of the species in these niches. Of these conditions, transcriptomic responses to temperature4, salinity4, oxygen requirements5, and radiation6,7 are well studied. For extremes of temperature, it has been previously shown that haloarchaea over-express chaperones (hsp and csp), DNA binding proteins (hpyA), and other previously characterized temperature stress genes/proteins8. For high energy (gamma) radiation, the haloarchaea have been shown to be the second most naturally resistant life form on the planet, slightly less resistant than Deinococcus radiodurans7. They are also able to withstand UV intensities about 100× higher than those experienced by organisms on the surface of Earth (>250 J/m2 vs. 2–3 J/m2)6,9,10. Haloarchaea are able to survive these conditions through an overexpression of DNA binding/repair proteins7,9–11.Although previous transcriptomic studies of the haloarchaea have not focused on pH, the response from other prokaryotic organisms such as Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis has been thoroughly examined12–14. These studies are important because of the role that pH plays in disease and its influence on the passage of prokaryotic species through and/or colonization of specific areas of the human body (e.g. acidic conditions in the stomach and beginning of the small intestine and alkaline conditions in the intestines). E. coli, when the environment is acidic, tends to use pathways that consume acids as well as increase the production of the inner membrane protein YagU and hydrogenases; however, when the environment is alkaline metabolic genes are up-regulated as are pathways that result in the production of acids to neutralize the effect of alkaline pH in the external environment12,14. For B. subtilis, acidic stress is of extreme importance because it leads to up-regulation of spore germinating genes, which allow the organism to survive in the hostile conditions of the stomach13,15.The best studied extremophilic organisms in regard to the effects of pH are the acidophiles and the alkaliphiles. These studies have primarily shown that these organisms survive via passive and active responses. Passive responses involve the modification of the cell wall/membrane to keep out excess H+ and OH- ions16,17. Active responses primarily involve pumping in/out specific ions. For alkaliphiles this is accomplished with the use of Na+/H+ antiporters where Na+ is pumped out of the cell and H+ is pumped in, as well as an up-regulation of pathways that produce acid16; however, the active processes used by acidophiles are not well known.Insights into the mechanisms of archaeal adaptations to the extremes of high salinity2 and acidity18 or alkalinity19 have been gained via genome sequencing projects by addressing each issue separately. However, more in depth knowledge of dual extremes is lacking. Haloarchaea are one of the few groups of Archaea that have been isolated from both extremes of the pH scale19,20 and therefore represent a novel group of organisms that are ideal subjects for studies to determine the transcriptomic responses from multiple extremes. On the lower end of the pH scale, haloarchaea are commonly found in acidic lakes such as Lake Afrera, Ethiopia, and Lake Aerodrome and Lake Brown in Western Australia20. On the higher end of the pH scale, the haloarchaea are commonly found in alkaline lakes such as Lake Natron and Lake Magadi in the Great Rift Valley in Africa as well as Mono Lake in California19,21.Therefore, we undertook the following study to determine the changes in transcriptomes of three well-studied haloarchaea: Halorubrum lacusprofundi, Haloferax volcanii, and Halobacterium sp. NRC-1, to understand the effects on the transcriptome associated with growth of haloarchaea at extremes of pH. These organisms were selected primarily because they have a fully sequenced genome and they can be easily grown and manipulated within the laboratory. However, they also represent a range of temperatures, 30°C (Hla) to 49°C (Hvo), and salinity, 2.5 (Hvo) to 4.2 M (NRC-1), optima. They are also naturally found across the glove and as we show below are able to grow in both acidic and alkaline conditions. As a result, the data gained from these studies will help determine if the transcriptomic responses are merely species specific, representative of the haloarchaea in general, or a part of a phylogenetically wider response to pH stress.","18 Sep 2014","Approved","Jesse Dillon, Department of Biological Sciences, California State University, CA, USA","Author Response (F1000Research Advisory Board Member) 15 Aug 2014"," I now approve the revised manuscript.

Owing to its universal accessibility, umbilical cord (UC) tissue represents an attractive source of MSCs for cell therapy1. However, the potency of standard culture-expanded UC MSCs, especially towards osteoblasts, chondrocytes and adipocytes, is lower compared to BM MSCs2,3. This can be explained by the fact that conventional UC MSC cultures arise from diverse clonal populations that possess varying degrees of self-renewal leading to mixed cultures that gradually lose their MSC properties4. The therapeutic advantages of minimally-expanded UC MSCs would therefore include a better preservation of their native functionality as well as rapid manufacture and reduced cost2. However, no agreement yet exists on the native phenotype of UC MSCs5–7, which is an essential pre-requisite for their isolation and minimal expansion.Prospective isolation of UC MSCs has been attempted after enzymatic digestion followed by selection for specific cell surface markers using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) or immunomagnetic bead separation techniques. Previous studies showed that CD45-based negative depletion5, neural ganglioside (GD2)-7 and CD146-based positive selection6,8,9 could be used to select for clonogenic and multipotential MSC fractions. Although CD146 is expressed on pericytes, which have been proposed as a reservoir of tissue specific progenitors and MSCs10,11, it is also present on the surface of CD31+ UC endothelial cells (ECs)2,6,9, and therefore cannot be used alone to achieve high-purity of UC MSC preparations.Whilst the majority of studies in this field used combinations of surface markers to isolate putative MSCs from different tissues, followed by their long-term clonal expansion and analysis of multipotentiality12, another alternative and faster approach could involve measuring the telomere length of freshly-sorted candidate MSC fractions. As immature cells, MSCs by definition should have longer telomeres compared to mature cell types. This idea was first proposed by Flores et al. (2008) who showed that stem cell compartments from hair follicles, intestine, testis, cornea and brain are enriched with cells with the longest telomeres13.The aims of this study were to confirm that CD146 could be a good MSC marker in the UC tissue and to purify candidate MSCs from UC tissue digests based on the non-haemopoietic (CD45-CD235a-), non-EC (CD31-), CD146+ phenotype. We measured telomere lengths in CD146+ and donor-matched control CD146- populations using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and examined the topography of CD146+ cells in situ using immunohistochemistry.","28 Aug 2014","Approved","Simone Pacini, Department of Oncology, Transplants and New Advances in Medicine, University of Pisa, Italy","Author Response 21 Aug 2014"," Authors addressed any queries and the revised manuscript clarifies all the aspects that were originally ambiguous, in the first version of the paper.

The authors extensively discussed the percentage of CD146-positive frequency in correlation to CFU-F frequency. Thus, the authors should clarify this aspect, and I strongly suggest clearing the flow cytometry data from the non-cellular events.” We are very grateful to Dr Pacini for his careful reading of our work and for his insightful comments. We believe that Figure 1A that he refers to is in fact Figure 2A as this pertains to our cell sorting experiments from umbilical cord (UC) tissue digests. We can confirm that we did perform FSC/SSC gating to remove anuclear red cells and cellular debris in all our sorting experiments. It was an oversight that this was omitted in the original submission and we thank the reviewer for highlighting this. We have now modified the relevant section of our Materials and Methods as well as Figure 2A to reflect this (gate R1). Additionally, we have added average percentage of cells within R1 out of all events collected into the appropriate Figure Legend. “As the CD146-positive and -negative populations are not sufficiently separated in the R4 gate, the sorting gates R5 and R6 should be defined by applying isotypic control.

In our experiments with UC tissue digests, a distinct CD45-CD235a-CD31-CD146+ population was always evident above the isotype control staining.” We further acknowledge that our original density plots failed to show that our sorting gates were always set apart to ensure maximal sorting purity. We have made new flow cytometry plots for panel 2A to reflect all of these changes (FSC/SSC gating and isotype control panel). “Purity, and possible Yield, of sorted cells should be indicated in the results section, in order to reassure the reader of the quality of the sorting process.”We have now provided information on CD146+ and CD146- fractions’ cell yields in Figure 2B, left panel. We acknowledge that we did not make clear in our original submission how many sorting experiments we performed in total, we confirm that this is ten for the sorting experiments. Fraction purities post-sort are always >95% using our cell sorter (see Churchman et al., 2012). “Telomere length has been described as T/S ratio, reported data are close to the value of 1.0 and two of four have values lower than 1.0. How could it be possible to detect telomere repeat copy numbers lower than the single copy gene (36B4)? According to Cawthon R.M. (2002) T/S ratios should be normalized. PCR efficiency could vary gene to gene, and should be evaluated in order to normalize qPCR data with the efficiency correction factor.”We appreciate this comment and agree that it is indeed a valid point that we should clarify further. Our method was based upon that of Cawthon R.M. (2002) as stated above and in the text, however when using unexpanded cells sorted from UC the cell numbers were limited because of the amount of tissue processed and inevitable cell losses caused by multiple centrifugation steps prior to cell sorting. Due to this we elected to standardise our telomere length experiments to 1000 sorted cells per fraction (previously overlooked from methods). We accept that we were working at the lower limit of DNA concentrations (acknowledgement of this is now added as a new sentence in Discussion), but believe that with triplicate replicates and extremely comparable standard curves (prepared using immortal cell lines) on each plate for inter-plate comparisons, our work is technically sound, and that our standardisation and technical control was suitable for comparing the differences between the CD146+ and CD146- populations. We did not normalise our T/S ratios and chose to show the data as a direct comparison of sample pairs and therefore some of these values fell below 1. This was also observed in the Cawthon paper; a ‘raw’ T/S ratio of 0.69 is what he normalised against to give the lowest value of 1 (Figure legend 5). Values below 1 can also be observed in Guillot et al. (2007).We have added an interesting observation that our umbilical cord T/S ratios fall closer to the adult tissues than the foetal tissues in that study. We now present normalized T/S ratios adjusted according to Cawthon R.M. (2002) in Figure 2C and conversion to telomere length in the text. We have also strengthened this figure with new data from a further 3 sorting experiments (new total n=7) and have performed statistical analysis. The CD146+ fraction possesses telomeres with median value 28bp longer than the CD146- fraction, although this was not significant (Wilcoxon). “From the density plots reported in figure 1A, it is not clear if a morphology gate was applied in the SSC/FSC plot, to exclude events of no-cellular origins.

Being able to provide ventilation by bag-mask, in face of a difficult or failed tracheal intubation, can make the difference between serious complications and disability.In the literature, the incidence of difficult mask ventilation (DMV) varies from 0.08% to 15% depending on the definition used1–4. Despite its importance, there are few predictors of DMV2–4 and a simple, objective, predictive score to identify patients at risk of DMV at the bedside does not currently exist.We present a retrospective-subgroup analysis of patients undergoing preoperative airway assessment before elective surgery5 at a major teaching hospital, to identify predictive factors for DMV and evaluate a composite score value, based on a comprehensive airway assessment and recorded outcomes.","17 Oct 2014","Approved","Adrian Matioc, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, William S.

Cattano et al. present a retrospective study derived from a database built of elective cases. There are several points I want to make:First, the study used a “real world clinical setting” confirming that in the daily practice difficult face mask ventilation is not a rare occurrence.Second, it introduced an objective assessment tool for the difficult face mask ventilation: capnography (further comment from the authors regarding this tool would be appreciated).Third: six out of the seven independent risk factors for the difficult face mask ventilation (age, BMI, neck circumference, presence of facial hair, perceived short neck, OSA) that were identified and then applied to evaluate a predictive model can be easily assessed or inferred with a clinical exam on an unconscious patient thus having probably a role in the outside of the operating room setting too.Fourth: the study confirms the importance of neck circumference, BMI and OSA in the difficult face mask ventilation paradigm. It is known that these clinical settings are plagued by inspiratory and expiratory obstruction at the soft palate level that does not respond to airway manoeuvres. The soft palate obstruction (relevant for nasal ventilation) can be by passed by committing to oral ventilation (by opening the mouth with an oropharyngeal airway). 1 2 It may be appropriate to recommend in these clinical settings a first (optimized) face mask ventilation attempt with an oropharyngeal airway in situ. References1.

This places a high burden on the Australian population, health care system and government. Up to 60% of Australians in subtropical Queensland over the age of 40 have AK2. AK lesions are rough scaly and generally less than 1 cm in diameter. They are caused by chronic sun exposure and prevented by regular sunscreen use3. Multiple lesions are common. Some lesions regress spontaneously, but others progress to invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Hypertrophic AK may contain occult foci of SCC4. A systematic review of the natural history of AK estimated the risk of malignant transformation to range from 0% to 0.0075%/lesion/year5. In individuals with a history of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), the risk is up 0.53% per lesion per year6. Organ transplant recipients on systemic immuno-suppressive therapies are at increased risk of malignant transformation7.Indications for treatment include prophylaxis of SCC, uncertainty of diagnosis, symptomatic relief and to improve cosmetic appearance. Detectable lesions are frequently associated with alterations of the surrounding skin. These surrounding subclinical lesions, or field changes, can be identified histologically and also clinically with the application of topical field therapy for AK8.Cryosurgery with liquid nitrogen is the most widely used therapy. Clinical response varies with the duration of application, as does morbidity. One study reported cure rates of 39% for freeze times less than 5 seconds, 69% for freeze times between 5 and 25 seconds and 83% for freeze times greater than 25 seconds9.Medicare Australia is a universal health insurance scheme that reimburses patients for medical fees incurred. Benefits are paid according to the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) with respect to each individual Medicare item number. The item number for treatment of 10 or more solar keratosis by cryosurgery is 30192. There is no item number for treatment of fewer than 10 AK and therefore no reimbursement for cryotherapy treatment of less than 10 AK.Field therapy is most useful for multiple AK lesions. Agents approved by the Therapeutics Goods Administration for field therapy include topical 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), diclofenac sodium, inguenol mebutate and photodynamic therapy (PDT). Field therapy is not subsidized by the PBS (Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme) and does not contribute directly to the cost to Government of treatment of AK in Australia.There is no current published estimate of the direct cost of AK to the Australian government. We aimed to use Medicare data to report the annual numbers of AK treatments between 1994 and 2012, calculate the direct costs associated with these treatments and predict the numbers and costs from 2013 to 2020.The risk of AK increases with age and the ageing of the Australian population may increase the burden of AK on the Australian health system.","25 Sep 2014","Approved","Luigi Naldi, Department of Dermatology, Centro Studi GISED, Italy","Author Response 16 Aug 2014"," The authors have addressed the critical points I raised.

Delays or interruptions during operating lists are associated with dissatisfaction for health care providers and patients alike2. Theatre lists account for a significant proportion of a hospital’s revenue and an even larger fraction of its total expenses3–6. As operating theatre budgets are already stretched, increased case throughput must come from improved theatre efficiency rather than from more operating sessions.Efficient use of theatre sessions relies on prompt start times, an appropriately booked theatre case-mix, efficient patient turnover, and finishing on time to reduce overtime costings7,8.

In clinical practice elevated serum GGT is generally used as an indicator of liver disease, such as biliary obstruction, alcohol consumption, and exposure to certain medical drugs1. Recently, several epidemiological studies have shown that a higher serum GGT level, even within the normal range, is associated with cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus and stroke, as well as certain types of cancer2–10. In contrast to these studies, we observed that after surgery for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm11 or after liver resection12, GGT is transiently increased in patients who had a good outcome. In these short-term observational studies GGT level was inversely related to other liver laboratory parameters such as aspartate aminotransferase (ALT), alanine aminotransferase (AST) as well as total bilirubin (TBI)11,12. We observe that in the early postoperative period after a liver transplantation (LT) a transient gradual increase in GGT also occurs. How early and late postoperative changes in serum GGT are related to survival is not known.Here we present a study in which we assessed the relationship between early (postoperative day seven) elevated GGT levels with early and late survival (i.e. survival within the 90 days and five years post-LT, respectively). We also evaluated the relationship between late (six months postoperatively) elevated GGT levels with late survival.In addition, we studied the early and late post-LT kinetics of GGT, AST, ALT, and TBI in patients who survived more than 90 days and in patients who did not. Likewise, these kinetics were compared with long-term survival.","10 Jul 2014","Approved","Peter Jansen, Division of Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases, University of Amsterdam, Netherlands","Author Response 10 Aug 2014"," This is an interesting paper providing novel insights into the value of traditional serum markers. It is quite true that the understanding of elevated GGT values is very limited, despite the fact that this value is one of the most requested 'liver function tests'. Most clinicians who request this test probably have no clear understanding what is being tested. It is very interesting that elevated GGT shortly after liver transplantation is associated with a better outcome. The title, abstract, data section, statistics and figures of the paper are OK, the discussion section could be a little more to the point.In my opinion there might be two reasons for an elevated GGT early after transplantation: 1) Elevated GGT is associated with oxidative stress, and some oxidative stress may prompt the hepatocyte to activate innate protective mechanisms; 2) Elevated GGT after transplantation may be an indicator of good early secretory function of the liver. GGT in part comes from the surface of the bile ducts and is released from the anchor which attaches this enzyme to the cell surface, by bile acids in bile. These same authors have shown that immediately after transplantation the bile acid/phospholipid ratio in bile is elevated and (as in MDR3 deficient/LPAC patients) this leads to elevated GGT. Thus elevated GGT immediately after transplantation indicates an active bile flow. This protects hepatocytes from cytotoxic bile acids. Later after transplantation when the BA/PL ratio has normalized, bile has lost some of its detergent action, with lower basal serum GGT levels as a result. When GGT is elevated at this stage it has become the traditional indicator of liver damage associated with a bad outcome, as the authors indicate.If the authors agree with this reasoning they could include some of these thoughts in the discussion section, in order to provide a little bit more insight into why elevation under some conditions may be beneficial as this, in my opinion, is the main and novel message of this paper.

Synaptic plasticity and especially long-term potentiation (LTP), a stable increase in synaptic strength, are emerging as the cellular equivalent of learning and memory (Gruart et al., 2006; Whitlock et al., 2006). Two key players involved in LTP are the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and the NMDA-type glutamate receptor (NMDAR). Ca2+ influx through the NMDAR leads to CaMKII activation and recruitment to the postsynaptic density (PSD), which can be persistent and synapse specific (Otmakhov et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2008) (but see also (Rose et al., 2009)). CaMKII binding to aa 1290–1309 on the NMDAR GluN2B subunit is required for this activity-dependent translocation (Halt et al., 2012; Leonard et al., 1999; Strack & Colbran, 1998; Strack et al., 2000) and is crucial for LTP (Barria & Malinow, 2005; Halt et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2007). Stimulation of CaMKII results in its auto-phosphorylation on T286 causing a persistent Ca2+-independent activation of CaMKII (Lisman et al., 2002). This auto-phosphorylation is increased after LTP and spatial learning in the Morris water maze (MWM) (Lengyel et al., 2004; Ouyang et al., 1997; Ouyang et al., 1999; Tan & Liang, 1996) and is required for effective binding of CaMKII to GluN2B (Bayer et al., 2001; Strack & Colbran, 1998). T286A CaMKII mutant mice exhibit no hippocampal NMDAR dependent LTP and have impaired MWM learning (Giese et al., 1998).We recently reported the specific disruption of CaMKII binding to GluN2B by point mutations in the GluN2B gene (Halt et al., 2012). The GluN2BKI mice contain two point mutations in the GluN2B C terminus (L1298A and R1300Q). Each of these mutations abolishes CaMKII binding to this site nearly completely in vitro (Strack et al., 2000). In vivo the two point mutations entirely abrogate the activity-dependent increase in the interaction with the NMDAR, show reduced hippocampal LTP by 50% and result in a MWM memory deficit, while acquisition of the MWM task and working memory as evaluated in the 8 arm win shift test remain normal (Halt et al., 2012).Now we report a specific moderate spatial learning deficit in the GluN2B knock in (KI) mice during massed 1-day training in the MWM. At the same time learning and memory recall in the Barnes maze and contextual fear conditioning are unaffected.","29 Sep 2014","Approved","Isabel Pérez-Otaño, Laboratorio de Neurobiología Celular, Departamento de Neurociencias, Centro de Investigacion en Medicina Aplicada, Spain",NA," The manuscript by Stein et al. expands previous work from the same group characterizing the learning abilities of CamKII knock-in mice (Halt et al., 2012). The mice carry two point mutations that impair the binding of CamKII to the NMDA receptor subunit GluN2B, and were shown to exhibit deficits in memory recall in the Morris Water maze (MWM).  Here, the authors present an extended and carefully performed behavioral analysis. Their new results show that spatial learning in the MWM is impaired when 12 training trials are compressed in a single day. In contrast, the previous study showed that spatial learning was normal when training was conducted over 6 consecutive days (2 trials per day). The different outcome is attributed to the increased cognitive demands and higher stress levels posed by massed training. The paper is well-written and clearly presented, and the Methods are described with enough detail.  Comments: The deficits in massed spatial learning are only detectable in the last two trials.  Do the authors have an explanation? Could the delay be related to a defect in an early phase of consolidation, in line with the hypothesis previously proposed by the authors (Halt et al., 2012)?  It might be nice to see whether memory consolidation is impaired in other hippocampal-dependent tests not involving stress. For instance, the novel object recognition test that can be performed in a brief period of time and would additionally permits the assessment of memory recall at shorter time intervals after initial learning.  I have read this submission.

Holocephalans are the more basal of the pair having first appeared more than 400 million years ago and include a single surviving order, Chimaeriformes, the chimaeras, with 39 extant species1. Elasmobranchs appeared approximately 350 million years ago and include more than 1000 species of sharks, skates, and rays2. Chondrichthyan fishes occupy a pivotal position at the base of the vertebrate phylogenetic tree. For research that includes an evolutionary component, representation of this diverse class affords a valuable perspective to evaluate all vertebrates.Chondrichthyan fishes are circumglobal in distribution and occupy a wide range of ecological habitats. Their life history parameters are equally disparate but in general chondrichthyans are slow growing and late maturing fishes with an increased risk of extinction3–5. Fecundity is as few as 1 or 2 for viviparous species such as the sand tiger shark, Carcharias taurus6 and as high as 300 for the whale shark, Rhincodon typus7. They are of economic importance for fisheries as well as ecotourism. Management and assessment of stock is essential to ensure both ecotourism interests and food resources remain sustainable8. Management of fish populations has increasingly relied on molecular tools to investigate population structure, properly identify species, and compliance with fishing quotas9–13.Elasmobranchs have been used as a model for biomedical research for more than 100 years. Elasmobranchs, like other cartilaginous fishes, exhibit many fundamental vertebrate characteristics, including a neural crest, jaws and teeth, an adaptive immune system, and a pressurized circulatory system. The skate is a powerful comparative model to study biological processes shared among jawed and limbed vertebrates such as development14–16, renal physiology17–20, immunology21–26, toxicology27, neurobiology28, and wound healing and regeneration29. They are the most ancient vertebrates to posses an adaptive immune system that generates antibodies using a V(D)J combinatorial mechanism30. Phylogenetically, cartilaginous fishes are the first vertebrates to possess a thymus, a central lymphoid organ that provides a microenvironment for the development of T cells31. The thymus shares a common organization with more derived vertebrates containing cortical and medullary regions32,33.In addition to shared physiological characteristics, the diversity of specializations between species allows investigations of evolution within a single clade. For example, elasmobranchs use a plethora of reproductive strategies that span the full range of maternal investment from placental viviparity to strict lecitrophic oviparity. Besides sexual reproduction, captive elasmobranchs are capable of asexual parthenogenesis34–36. Of these reproductive mechanisms, the most tractable for research purposes is oviparity. Approximately 43% of chondrichthyans utilize oviparity including all Chimaeriformes, Heterodontiformes (bullhead sharks), Rajoidae (skates) and Scyliorhinidae (catsharks)37. Many species can be maintained in captivity and will breed and lay eggs throughout an annual season38. Artificial insemination has been reported for two oviparous species, the clearnose skate, Raja eglanteria39, and the cloudy catshark, Scyliorhinus torazame40. Additionally, sperm storage allows wild caught females to lay eggs for several years without requiring males or captive mating events41. Leucoraja erinacea, the little skate, was chosen for a genome sequencing project to represent this clade of fishes because of their use as a biomedical model, experimental tractability, genome size, existing sequence data, and northeast regional distribution. The sequencing project is an ongoing effort of the North East Bioinformatics Collaborative (NEBC) of the North East Cyberinfrastructure Consortium (NECC), composed of the bioinformatics core facilities from Delaware, Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont funded by National Institutes of Health (NIH) Institutional Development Awards (IDeA) and/or National Science Foundation (NSF) Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) programs.","01 Sep 2014","Approved","Ed Heist, Department of Zoology, Southern Illinois University, IL, USA",NA," This manuscript has two components: a description of current genomic, proteomic, and transcriptomic resources for chondrichthyan fishes and a description of the SkateBase project.  Of the two, I would rather have seen more emphasis on SkateBase since the rate at which new data are being generated will make the survey data presented in the manuscript increasingly incomplete.  Nevertheless I think it is a good paper worthy of publication and SkateBase seems to be a valuable resource.Specific comments include:Abstract – capitalize Sarcopterygii, Actinopterygii misspelled.  Throughout the manuscript there are numerous inconsistencies in capitalization, e.g. “order Chimaeriformes” and “Fish barcode of life (FISH-BOL) a working group of the International Barcode of Life Project (iBOL)” both on page 8.Introduction – In the first sentence replace “Chondrichthyan fishes” with “Living chondrichthyan fishes.”Paragraph 2 – The text implies that the only benefits of chondrichthyans are ecotourism and fisheries.  Perhaps a mention of ecological services (e.g. food-web dynamics) or other benefits of chondrichthyan conservation would be appropriate here.Paragraph 4 – “asexual” parthenogenesis seems redundant.Paragraph 5  – perhaps some more details on the distribution, life history, reproductive mode, genome size etc. of little skate is in order.  Why is the geographic location of the species relevant?Figure 1 is hard for me to decipher.  I can’t figure out what the two separate outer rings indicate and why the spacing between them is different for the orders vs. the families, genera, and species.  I really think this figure is too complex and tries to cram too much information that is peripheral to the goals of the paper into a single figure.  I may be old fashioned, but I think a table that listed the numbers of families, genera, and species would have been sufficient.  There also needs to be a citation on the source of the information as the taxonomy and number of recognized species of chondrichthyans is changing. Figure 4B – A citation is needed for the cladogram.

Recently there has been concern over general global trends of reduced pollinator species abundance and diversity that are both predicted to reduce pollination rates to plants (Memmott et al., 2007; Potts et al., 2010). Climate induced plant-pollinator mismatch can reduce pollination rates by creating a temporal mismatch in pollinator emergence and plant flowering times (Hegland et al., 2009). Pollinator emergence is regulated by temperature, whereas plant bloom time is regulated by photoperiod (Hegland et al., 2009). If climate warming shifts pollinator emergence but not plant bloom time, then a temporal mismatch between plants and pollinators occurs (Hegland et al., 2009). This scenario is likely more pronounced in alpine and polar environments that are experiencing a more rapid increase in annual temperature than the global average (very high confidence; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC], 2013). Conceivably, both of these reductions in pollination rates occur simultaneously and thus adaptability of different sexual morphs in alpine plants can be an important consideration in predicting responsiveness and variation in reproductive output.Hypotheses associated with pollen availability in alpine environments are controversial. It has been assumed that pollination rates are inherently low in alpine environments (Larson & Barrett, 2000; Totland & Sottocornola, 2001; Torres-Díaz et al., 2011). This is attributed to low temperatures, overcast conditions, strong winds, and relatively unpredictable weather being challenging for insect pollinators (Körner, 1999). These harsh conditions generally lead to lower pollinator diversity, abundance, and activity in alpine ecosystems relative to milder ecosystems (Kevan, 1972; Primack, 1978; Moldenke & Lincoln, 1979; Arroyo et al., 1982; Primack, 1983; Billings, 1987; Totland, 1993). Alternatively, pollination rates can increase with elevations suggesting adequate pollen availability under current conditions (Arroyo et al., 1985; Arroyo & Squeo, 1990; Bingham & Orthner, 1998; Utelli & Roy, 2000).The reproductive assurance hypothesis (RAH) and the stress gradient hypothesis (SGH) are thus highly relevant hypotheses to explore in the alpine. The RAH proposes that when pollen supply is low, self-compatible plants are favored over self-incompatible plants (Lloyd, 1992; Lloyd & Schoen, 1992). This is because self-compatible plants create their own pollen thereby being more adapted to low or variable pollination rates (Larson & Barrett, 2000; Muñoz & Arroyo, 2006; García-Camacho & Totland, 2009). Further, it has been proposed that self-compatible plants are less likely to become extinct if pollinators drastically decrease or disappear from a given system (Richards, 1997; Morgan et al., 2005). Therefore, self-compatible plants may become favored in the future if pollen supply declines. The SHG is also an important ecological theory to consider in the possibility of reduced pollination rates and therefore reduce pollen supply. The SHG states that facilitation between two plant species is more common when resources are limited (Bertness & Callaway, 1994). Typically, the stress gradient hypothesis is tested using a gradient of environmental condition such as altitude (Cavieres & Badano, 2009) or moisture (Cavieres et al., 2006), but has not been applied to the concept of pollen supply limitations which could be categorized as a quantifiable limiting resource (Maestre et al., 2009). Taken together, these sets of ecological theories provide a solid platform to build pollen limitation studies upon and provide a set of potential ecological drivers that can help predict pollination rate changes in the alpine.Here, we use a gynodioecious population of Silene acaulis to assess the sensitivity of different genders to pollen limitation and the potential effect of beneficiary plant species on these cushions. We test the following predictions associated with the reproductive assurance hypothesis: (1) that the reproduction of self-incompatible plants is more sensitive to reduced pollen deposition than that of self-compatible plants and (2) self-incompatible plants will be less viable under experimentally reduced pollen deposition. In doing so, we also explore whether pollen supply can be viewed as a resource stress within the stress gradient hypothesis. Specifically, we predict that facilitation between cushions and beneficiaries to increase when pollen supply is reduced.","14 Aug 2014","Approved","Fabio Bulleri, Dipartimento di Biologia, Università di Pisa, Italy","Author Response 07 Jul 2014"," I think this new version reads well and no further changes are required.

COPD results in a reduced capacity for functional activities and performance of daily activities with a corresponding impairment in Health Related Quality of Life2. Current figures show 900,000 people have been diagnosed with and are receiving treatment for COPD within the United Kingdom3. However, due to under reporting or under diagnosis, the actual number of those suffering with COPD is estimated to be as high as 3 million4. Stopping smoking is crucial and is the only intervention that influences the natural history of lung deterioration, with current pharmacological treatment being aimed at reducing symptoms and exacerbations5.Pulmonary Rehabilitation Programmes are multi-disciplinary interventions individually tailored to optimise each patient’s physical and social performance. Rigorous evidence from randomised controlled trials demonstrates that Pulmonary Rehabilitation Programmes for COPD can improve dyspnoea, exercise tolerance, Health Related Quality of Life, and reduce the number of days spent in hospital and the utilisation of healthcare resources6–8. Pulmonary Rehabilitation Programmes have been shown to be cost-effective and are now recommended for all patients who remain breathless despite optimal bronchodilators, irrespective of severity and age6–9. Pulmonary Rehabilitation Programmes are also being effectively applied to non-COPD causes of pulmonary impairment10.There are now specific guidelines and recommendations in the United Kingdom regarding Pulmonary Rehabilitation Programmes, including how to select patients, the timing and number of sessions, intensity and type of exercise, the key educational, psychological and behavioural components, oxygen supplementation and outcome assessment7,8. Research exploring the benefits following Pulmonary Rehabilitation Programmes has predominantly been quantitative in nature. There have been some qualitative studies with COPD patients, but these have focused largely on specific aspects of patient experience11,12 and barriers to participation in Pulmonary Rehabilitation Programmes or other self-management programmes13,14. There has been some exploration of the effectiveness of self-management programmes from the patient perspective15–17. However, none of these studies have combined patient, carer, and professional perspectives, particularly in an in-depth analysis regarding the long-term impact of Pulmonary Rehabilitation Programmes in relation to personal needs and issues such as perceived patient benefits, and expectations and challenges of Pulmonary Rehabilitation Programmes. It has been recognised that a better understanding of how Pulmonary Rehabilitation Programmes improve Health Related Quality of Life could affect the future design of programmes, enhance measurement tools for Health Related Quality of Life and more appropriately support the specific needs of patients15,17,18.Consensus methods are techniques used to gain opinions and views from appropriate experts regarding the current position in a particular field. They provide a mechanism for assimilating and synthesising information, particularly where published information may be inadequate or non-existent19. The purpose of consensus methods is to reach an agreement on a particular issue. Consensus methods can also mitigate some of the problems sometimes associated with group decision-making processes. In particular, where dominant views may lead the process and crowd out other perspectives19.Nominal Group Technique is one of the commonly used consensus methods within healthcare and medical settings. The technique was first developed as an organisational planning technique by Delbecq et al. in the 1970s20. The Nominal Group Technique normally involves four main phases: a nominal phase, during which each individual silently considers the issues under deliberation; an item-generation phase, during which each individual discloses the results of their deliberation to the group; a discussion and clarification phase, during which the group assures itself that it has understood the items that have been advanced; and a voting phase, during which the items are evaluated and the issue is decided (e.g. a ranking exercise). Nominal Group Technique promotes individual contributions allowing each individual the opportunity to voice their opinions. Factors that would normally inhibit participation are therefore avoided and even the more reticent group members are encouraged to participate in all phases21.By adopting a mixed methods design, employing qualitative and quantitative methods during consultation with mixed stakeholder groups, and by including a modified Nominal Group Technique component as described previously22, we aimed to provide a picture of the perceived benefits and challenges of Pulmonary Rehabilitation Programmes for COPD patients. The purpose of this chosen approach was to employ combined quantitative and qualitative methods in order to gain a common consensus regarding the relative importance of the issues generated. Here we report the quantitative aspect of the Nominal Group Technique activities, whereby the most favoured rank is selected as being the most important.","13 Aug 2014","Approved","Amanda Stears, Department of Physiotherapy, School of Health Sciences, Queen Margaret University, UK","Author Response 22 Jul 2014"," I am happy with the amendments that have been made to this article.

These critical periods are limited to specific windows of time that are different for each sensory system. In the visual system, the primary visual cortex is subjected to a critical period for ocular dominance plasticity during which connections from a weak or absent eye can be permanently overtaken by the strong eye2. The integrated action between inhibitory and excitatory circuits determines critical period onset, with a major role being played by the maturation of fast-spiking parvalbumin (FSPV) interneurons3. We have shown that Otx2 homeoprotein helps determine critical period timing by signaling FSPV cells in mice4. Conditional knock-down in heterozygous floxed mice just prior to normal critical period timing is sufficient to delay onset, while cortical infusion of recombinant Otx2 protein accelerates both onset and closure4.Remarkably, Otx2 protein in the cortex is non-cell autonomous. The Otx2 locus is silent, as shown by PCR, in situ hybridization and Otx2+/GFP mice, while Otx2 protein is detectable by immunohistochemistry and immunoblot4,5. We have shown that cortical infusion of recombinant Otx2 protein results in specific uptake by FSPV cells, while injection in the retina results in its transport along the visual pathway and into these same cells4. Blocking extracellular Otx2 through infusion of antibodies or specific peptides reduces uptake of endogenous Otx2 in FSPV cells4,6. Furthermore, we recently showed that the choroid plexus expresses Otx2 and secretes it into the cerebrospinal fluid5. Conditional knockdown of Otx2 expression in the choroid plexus results in reduced cortical levels of Otx2 protein. Needless to say, all of these approaches that alter Otx2 protein levels in the visual cortex have resulted in changes in cortical plasticity timing7.An outstanding question is whether cortical Otx1 homeoprotein also plays a role in the critical period. Indeed, Otx1 is expressed in the cerebral cortex during development and continues to be expressed by layer V neurons in the adult8. It is thus possible that it is secreted by layer V cells and transferred into above granular and supragranular layers where Otx2 protein is detected. Unfortunately, most antibodies (commercial and academic) for Otx1 and Otx2 are pan-Otx thereby ruling out immunohistochemical approaches for conclusive evidence. Since genetic manipulation of the Otx2 locus has resulted in reduced protein in layer IV visual cortex7, we sought confirmation whether Otx1 is also present in these layers in the adult by using Otx1 knockout mice and proteomic approaches.","08 Aug 2014","Approved","Paola Bovolenta, Centro de Biología Molecular Severo Ochoa, CSIC-UAM, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Spain","Author Response (Member of the F1000 Faculty) 20 Apr 2015"," Studies, mostly from A. Prochiantz’s laboratory, have demonstrated that the transcription factor (TF) Otx2, produced by external sources such as the choroid plexus, is internalized into parvalbumin neurons of layers II/III and IV of the visual cortex, thereby controlling its plasticity. So far these studies had not ruled out the possibility that part of this effect could be mediated by Otx1, a closely related TF, which may act redundantly with Otx2. In this study, the authors combined the use of Otx1-/- mice with immunoprecipitation from layers I-IV extracts and high-resolution mass spectrometry analysis to demonstrate the sole presence of Otx2 peptides in these layers. The study thus demonstrates that Otx2 is the only non-cell autonomous Otx family member functional in fast-spiking parvalbumin cells of layers I-IV of the visual cortex. This is a clear and well-executed study that solves an existing concern.  I have read this submission.

Continue reading We thank Pierre Godement for his insightful reading of our article.We are well aware that the rat antibody recognizes both Otx1 and Otx2 (as it was produced in our laboratory and kindly provided to Pierre Godement through Marion Wassef). Indeed, the Otx1 knockout mouse contains a truncated form of Otx1. In a previous study to which Pierre Godement makes reference, protein staining with an Otx1-specific antibody is extremely faint and non-nuclear throughout all cortical layers of the homozygous Otx1 knockout mouse (Weimann et al., 1999). While it is possible that our antibody also recognizes a truncated form of Otx1, Figure 1B clearly shows that staining in layer V (a bona fide site of Otx1 expression) is decreased in the knockout as compared to wild type. Furthermore, we continue to find nuclear staining in other cortical layers, contrary to what was found with the Otx1 antibody. This link contains the raw microscope images and includes an image of the heterozygous Otx1 mouse visual cortex, which shows similar staining to wild type. (Ratio of Otx cells in infragranular versus supragranular layers in these images is 1.43, 1.46, and 1.11 for WT, het, and homozygote mice, respectively.)We have not stained for PV (since it was not necessary in the context of this paper) but have used the WFA lectin (that recognizes the PNNs surrounding PV-cells). Contrary to what Pierre Godement writes, we did not say in Sugiyama et al. (2008) that the Otx2 antibody stains ""all parvalbumin positive"" cells. Figure 1J and page 3 of the article clearly state that 71.4 +/- 0.5% of Otx2-positive cells are PV-positive and that 78.9 +/- 1.7% of the PV-positive cells are Otx2-positive.One must indeed be cautious with pan-Otx antibodies; genetic evidence for non-cell autonomous cortical Otx2 is paramount. In Sugiyama et al. (2008), in addition to using 6 different Otx2 antibodies, we recombined Otx2 by crossing Otx2 floxed mouse with a CamKII-Cre mouse and lost Otx2 staining in PV-cells. Because CamKII is not expressed in PV-cells, this demonstrated the non-cell autonomous accumulation of Otx2. In addition, we have identified the choroid plexus as a source of Otx2. Recombining the Otx2 locus specifically in this structure reduced the amount of Otx2 in cortical PV-cells and reopened plasticity in the adult (Spatazza et al., 2013).It is correct that immunoprecipitation (IP) gels show Otx2 with an apparent MW just under 40 kD. This is where Otx2 runs under our conditions (NuPAGE 4%-12%, MES buffer). This link contains the full western blots corresponding to Figures 2A and 2C. Along with the IPs from visual cortex and choroid plexus, the full blot corresponding to Figure 2A includes an extract from retina (a primary structure strongly expressing Otx2). The velocity for Otx2 is identical for all 3 structures. MW markers and samples from an IP with another pan-Otx antibody (Millipore AB9566) are also included.No in situ studies have shown Otx1 mRNA expression above layer V in the cortex, but the presence of Otx1 protein due to transfer between the layers is a possibility. Our mass spectroscopy analysis of supgranular layer IPs found two peptides corresponding to Otx1 and Otx2, but also one peptide unique for Otx2 (Dataset 1 and Figure 2D). In Figure 2C (supragranular layers), we only find one band migrating with the Otx2 velocity and recognized by Otx antibodies (IP and western blot). It is based on this result that we conclude there is no Otx1 in these layers. The questions of Otx2 amount, location and provenance are not within the scope of this article.Finally, Pierre Godement raises two additional points. First is that he has made plasticity-related observations concerning axon guidance based on the regulation of extracellular matrix protein expression by Otx2 (Nguyen Ba-Charvet et al., 1998). We agree with this potential impact on cortical plasticity and indeed cited this work in Sugiyama et al. (2008).Second, Pierre Godement proposes that it is Otx1 that regulates the termination of the critical period and not Otx2. We do not exclude that Otx1 and many other proteins participate in critical period regulation but we maintain that Otx2 is a primary factor in the regulation of postnatal and adult cortical plasticity. Whether Otx1 is involved still awaits demonstration.In conclusion, we sincerely thank Pierre Godement for giving us the opportunity to discuss some points that may not have been explained with enough clarity.

The decrease in procoagulant proteins is evidenced by prolonged test results of routine coagulation assays such as the prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT). Historically, due to an increased bleeding risk during surgery in combination with prolonged conventional coagulation tests and thrombocytopenia, liver disease patients were thought to be in a hypocoagulable state. In recent years it has become increasingly accepted that cirrhosis patients have a rebalanced hemostatic system which is not adequately represented by routine coagulation tests as they are only sensitive for procoagulant proteins and do not take the concomitant decrease in antihemostatic proteins into account2,3. The rebalanced hemostatic system is more fragile as compared to healthy individuals and may decompensate towards hypo- or hypercoagulability by factors such as renal failure, trauma, infection, and surgery1. Besides bleeding complications, patients with cirrhosis are also at risk for thrombotic complications and this particular clinical scenario has only recently been fully appreciated4–8.Patients with cirrhosis who undergo orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) show a rapid normalisation of coagulation proteins due to the intact synthetic capacity of the transplanted liver. Previous studies performed in our laboratory have shown that hemostatic capacity early after OLT appears adequate, but shows important differences when compared to healthy individuals. At 10 days after OLT, when synthetic function of the liver as assessed by PT and APTT values is adequate, multiple laboratory parameters suggest that the patients are in a hypercoagulable state. Specifically, we have shown an unbalanced von Willebrand factor (VWF)/ADAMTS13 system9 and enhanced thrombin generation2. Also, we have shown a decreased fibrinolytic potential up to five days after surgery10.Clinically, this hypercoagulable status is evidenced by a profoundly increased risk for thrombotic complications such as hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT). While previously HAT was assumed to be a solely surgical complication, there is emerging evidence for the involvement of the hemostatic system in the development of HAT11. In addition, liver transplant recipients are at increased risk for arterial thrombotic events. The risk for thrombotic complications remains increased months and even years after OLT compared to the general population and a substantial part of morbidity and mortality in liver transplant recipients who survive the first year after transplantation is due to vascular events12,13. Long-term vascular complications are mainly ascribed to the use of immunosuppressive medication12. Besides the known metabolic risk profile associated with the use of immunosuppressive medication, several in vitro studies have provided evidence for a prohemostatic effect of such drugs14,15.While there is laboratory evidence for a hypercoagulable state during and directly after OLT, it is unclear whether the hypercoagulability persists and, if so, for how long. To our knowledge there has been no study investigating the hemostatic potential in liver transplant recipients long after a successful transplant. We aimed to investigate the long-term status of the hemostatic system by various assays of hemostatic competence in patients one year after OLT. Understanding the hemostatic state of transplanted patients is essential for clinical practice and for the development of preventive measures for short- and long term vascular complications.","14 Aug 2014","Approved","Alex Gatt, Haematology Department, Mater Dei Hospital, Malta","Author Response (F1000Research Advisory Board Member) 22 Jul 2014"," No more comments.

For technical reasons and to facilitate comparison as well as reproducibility between different experiments, a limited number of control strains have been established in most model organisms. For instance, the C57BL, 129 and FVB strains are commonly used in mouse studies; N2 is the common control strain used in Caenorhabditis elegans; and Canton-Special (CS) is one of the most-used wild-type strains in Drosophila melanogaster genetics studies. The CS stock was established by C. B. Bridges1 and chosen because of its low mutation rate. S. Benzer introduced CS to what was to become neurogenetics in his landmark study in 19672, because of its strong fast-phototaxis response. The strain has been used as a control in neurogenetics studies ever since.With time and reproductive isolation, populations of laboratory control strains can diverge, in spite of ideal breeding conditions and seemingly little selective pressure. Several studies comparing the behavior of sub-strains of mice showed that their behavior differs3. For instance, Paylor and colleagues measured that one sub-strain of C57 mice showed a higher startle amplitude after tactile stimulation than another4. Similarly, the behavior of different N2 C. elegans sub-strains was found to vary to a considerable extent5.In this study, we tested five different CS Drosophila melanogaster sub-strains in Buridan’s paradigm6–8), where flies walk between two stripes on a platform surrounded by a water moat. We could separate the CS sub-strains into three groups according to their behavior during the experiment. In addition, we found that the between-strain variability in the stripe fixation score is particularly high. We discuss possible solutions to prevent sub-strain related problems.","02 Sep 2014","Approved","Hiromu Tanimoto, Graduate School of Life Sciences, Tohoku University, Japan",NA," Colomb and Brembs reported an important piece of information that highlights large differences in the walking trajectory of six substrains of a wild-type Drosophila strain (Canton S) in the so-called Bridan paradigm. Drawing conclusions from behavioral comparisons of strains could therefore be moot, if the tested strains do not share the same genetic background (at least for the Buridan paradigm).This report is presented in a clear and succinct way. In addition, the authors invite submission of data by other labs, and the addition of these new data will be plotted in Fig. 4. This is an interesting endeavor which nicely uses the function of this journal. One has yet to keep in mind that fly behavior can be dramatically affected by ‘unwritten’ lab conditions (e.g. fly food, rearing conditions), and therefore the new data from other labs might not be comparable to the current dataset. One suggestion for the contributing labs to circumvent this caveat is to use one (or more) of the strains analyzed in this study and to check the reproducibility.In addition, I have a few minor comments that may be addressed:The authors argue that the basis of the behavioral variability is differences in the genetic background, but other reasons (e.g. epigenetic differences) can conceivably contribute to the variability as well. The authors state that there was a significant effect of the replicate on Principal Component 2 (page 3, left column, third line from bottom), but later state that “(…) sub-strain differences were comparable in the two replicates conducted one year apart” (page 5, left column, line 5 from top). Either of the statements should be amended.  “A” in “PCA” stands for analysis. Use “PCA” instead of “PCA analysis”. My understanding of PCA is “Principal Component Analysis” rather than “Principle Component Analysis” the authors use in the paper.

Besides innate immune mechanisms3,4, CD4+ T cells of the adaptive immune system promote adult hippocampal neurogenesis and convey functional benefits in reversal learning that have been related to adult neurogenesis5–7. However the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying CD4+ T cell-mediated enhancement of adult neurogenesis have largely remained unclear. For example, whether or not the infiltration of myelin-reactive T cells into the CNS is a prerequisite for the proneurogenic activity of CD4+ T cells has been controversially discussed5,6,8,9. Additionally, the relative contribution of the activation or differentiation status of the CD4+ T cells to their proneurogenic activity remains to be determined. This includes CD4+ T cell-derived soluble factors that could either act directly on hippocampal precursor cells or promote precursor cell activity through indirect mechanisms, e.g. by acting on neighbouring cells within the neurogenic niche of the adult hippocampus.Upon appropriate T cell and cytokine receptor signals, initially naïve CD4+ T cells can differentiate into different T helper (Th) cell subsets with distinct cytokine profiles and effector functions10–12. This includes interleukin-17 (IL-17)-producing Th17 cells that additionally express the orphan nuclear receptor ROR-<U+03B3>t. Besides mediating anti-microbial immunity at epithelial barriers13–17, ROR-<U+03B3>t+ Th17 cells have been broadly linked to the pathogenesis of various autoimmune and chronic inflammatory conditions18–23, most notably demyelinating inflammatory disorders of the CNS, such as multiple sclerosis in humans and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in rodents. In EAE, a local reactivation of myelin-reactive Th17 cells that have crossed the blood-brain barrier initiates a cascade of neuroinflammatory responses, ultimately leading to demyelination in the CNS and neurodegeneration. More recent evidence suggests that there are different subsets of Th17 cells comprising a wide spectrum of effector phenotypes. Among these are nonpathogenic Th17 cells with regulatory properties that restrict tissue destruction during inflammatory responses and promote tissue remodeling and repair14,24–29. This together with the broad expression of surface receptors for Th17-derived cytokines on both immune and non-immune cells15,16,30, prompted us to assess the capacity of myelin-reactive Th17 cells to enhance precursor cell proliferation in an aß T cell-deficient mouse model of impaired hippocampal neurogenesis.","26 Aug 2014","Approved with Reservations","Francis G. Szele, Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics, University of Oxford, UK",NA," The link between the immune system and neurogenesis has become increasingly interesting with some papers showing positive and others showing negative effects in health and disease. It is likely that different subsets of immune cells, and different states of activation are in part responsible for these discrepancies. This short paper begins to address the need for detailed examination of these immune cell subsets by showing that systemic adoptive transfer of myelin reactive T17 cells into a mouse model with T cell deficiency rescues proliferation in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. This appears to occur without the need for direct cell contact since the majority of mice did not have significant numbers of transplanted T cells in the hippocampus.The decrease in TCRa-/- DG proliferation, though statistically significant, is rather small and one wonders whether these differences would translate into functional differences. Is there also increased neurogenesis? The paper would benefit from additional experiments showing neurogenic changes are paralleled by behavioral changes. Could it be that T17 cells migrated into and then left the DG within the first week after adoptive transfer? What are the kinetics of T cell immigration and emigration into the DG? Did you exclude the animal (Fig. 2E2) with significant T cell infiltration from your analysis? The authors present a hypothesis that T cell derived cytokines affect DG neurogenesis.

In addition, protein aggregation has been shown to play a role in aging3 as well as cardiomyocyte autophagy4 and type II diabetes5–7. Remarkably, for the above mentioned diseases, aggregation/insolubility of specific proteins can be triggered by either genetic mutations (familiar) or environmental insults (sporadic), which strongly implies that a common mechanism may exist to initiate both familiar and sporadic forms of these clinically distinct diseases. Paradoxically, recent studies have suggested that the accumulation of aggregates is unlikely to be the first step in pathogenesis7–9. However, the common mechanism to initiate these diseases still remains to be elucidated1,7–9.ALS is the most prevalent fatal motor neuron disease, yet its underlying mechanism still remains a mystery despite intense studies since the first description more than 130 years ago10. Approximately 10% of ALS cases have a hereditary background, while the other cases are sporadic10. ALS8 was identified from a large Brazilian family, and encodes a mutated P56S major sperm protein MSP domain of VAPB (vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein B)11. In the cytosol, the 125-residue MSP domain adopts a seven-stranded immunoglobulin-like ß-sandwich fold (Figure 1A), which is anchored onto the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) surface (Figure 1B)12. The MSP domain can also be cleaved from its transmembrane anchor to serve as a ligand for the EphA4 receptor1,14, which is the only-known ALS modifier15. Noticeably, inhibition of EphA4 by a small molecule, called C1, which targets the EphA4 ligand binding channel16,17 rescued the disease phenotype in ALS models15.Figure 1. ALS-causing P56S mutation triggers the transformation of the all-ß cytosolic MSP domain into a membrane-interacting protein which remodels ER to have stacked cisternae.A. 125-residue wild-type MSP domain adopting a seven-stranded immunoglobulin-like ß-sandwich fold, with Pro56 displayed in spheres. B. The wild-type MSP domain of VAPB is anchored onto the ER membrane facing the cytosol by a C-terminal transmembrane fragment. C. The ALS-causing P56S mutant is able to remodel ER to have stacked cisternae by acquiring ability of the P56S MSP to interact with membranes. D. Far-UV CD spectrum of the wild-type MSP domain (black), typical of a ß structure; and spectra of the P56S MSP in aqueous solution (cyan); in DMPC vesicle (green), bicelle formed by DMPC and DHPC (blue) as well as in DPC micelle (red) at pH 4.0. E. Far-UV CD spectra of the P56S MSP in DMPC vesicle (purple), bicelle formed by DMPC and DHPC (green) and in DPC micelle (blue) in 5 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7.5.The ALS-causing P56S mutation renders VAPB to form detergent-resistant aggregates in vivo upon overexpression18. In vitro, we have shown that indeed the P56S MSP mutant is completely insoluble in buffers12. Nevertheless, our unique discovery that all insoluble proteins, including the most hydrophobic integral membrane peptide, could be dissolved in unsalted water and manifest their intrinsic conformations19–22 allowed us to characterize the residue-specific conformation of the P56S MSP domain in aqueous solution by NMR spectroscopy12. Remarkably, we showed that the P56S mutation is sufficient to completely eliminate its native ß-sandwich fold and consequently the P56S MSP domain becomes predominantly-disordered, only with weakly-populated helical conformations over several regions. As such, both in vivo and in vitro results highlight the association of the aggregation of the P56S mutant with the ALS pathogenesis.On the other hand, a recent study failed to detect any significant accumulation of aggregates in motor neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells of patients carrying the P56S mutation23, suggesting that the accumulation of the P56S VAPB aggregates is not the primary trigger for ALS8 pathogenesis. Furthermore, two recent studies showed that the P56S mutant acquired a novel ability to remodel the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to have stacked cisternae even without needing the accumulation of aggregates/inclusions24,25. On the other hand, we discovered that the unstructured P56S, but not wild-type MSP domain, is able to insert into a membrane environment to become a helical structure26, thus providing the underlying mechanism (Figure 1C) for the observation22,24,25.To shed light on how a point mutation can transform a well-folded, all-ß domain into a helical membrane protein, as well as understanding the role of this transformation in initiating ALS pathogenesis, here by solution NMR spectroscopy and paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE), we determined the three-dimensional topology and dynamics of the 125-residue P56S MSP domain in a membrane environment. This represents the first three-dimensional topology of the membrane-embedded helical proteins which are transformed from a well-folded cytosolic all-ß domain. Astonishingly, the P56S MSP domain is mostly embedded in the membrane environment with high backbone rigidity, and is composed of five well-formed helices at N- and C-ends linked by a long unstructured loop. Although no membrane-associated fragments could be detected based on hydrophobicity used for identifying classic membrane proteins, the helical residues were found to possess high amphiphilicity that was comparable to those of the membrane-active toxin mellitin and the intrinsically-unstructured a-synuclein that cause Lewy body diseases. This immediately reveals the mechanism for the chameleon transformation: the P56S mutation acts to convert the well-folded cytosolic MSP domain into an unstructured membrane-active protein like mellitin and a-synuclein, by disrupting the specific long-range interaction network that stabilizes the native ß-sandwich MSP fold12. Consequently, the previously locked intrinsic amphiphilic and other hydrophobic regions are released and accessible to bulk solvent, which leads to severe aggregation in buffers but, on the other hand, also drives partition into membranes. Since we, and others have extensively shown that insoluble proteins lack tight tertiary packing19–22,27,28; and segments with high intrinsic amphiphilicity universally exist in all proteins including random sequences, regardless of their native structures29,30, our current study thus resolves the paradox by deciphering that all disease-associated proteins, regardless of being partly-soluble like a-synuclein or insoluble like the P56S MSP, share a common mechanism to attack membranes without needing aggregates. This mechanism might represent the initial step in triggering familiar, sporadic and aging diseases.","23 Jul 2014","Approved","H Jane Dyson, Department of Molecular Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, USA",NA," The newly revised manuscript is now acceptable.

CIP is often associated with an acute, primary myopathy called critical illness myopathy (CIM), and both conditions occur in patients with multiple organ dysfunctions and failure (MOF). Indeed, CIP and CIM represent the failure of the neuromuscular system in patients with MOF1. CIP classically presents as a sensory-motor axonal polyneuropathy causing difficulty in weaning patients from a ventilator, flaccid limbs, and a possible reduction in deep tendon reflexes. Amplitude reduction of both the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) and the sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) is the predominant electrophysiological finding in CIM and CIP; latency and nerve conduction velocity remain normal or are only slightly decreased. CIM is a primary myopathy with distinctive electrophysiological and morphological findings1. Other features of CIM include increased CMAP duration, normal SNAPs, reduced muscle excitability on direct stimulation and myopathic motor unit potentials on needle electromyography. The clinical features are often the same as for CIP, but sensation, if testable, is normal.Traditional methods to diagnose CIP and CIM include manual testing of muscle strength using the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) score2 or dynamometry3 to demonstrate severe weakness, electrophysiological tests to explore the function of peripheral nerves and muscles, and muscle biopsy1. Conventional nerve conduction studies (NCS) with measurement of conduction velocity, CMAP and SNAP amplitudes, electromyography (EMG) and other specialised techniques such as direct muscle stimulation or axonal excitability testing may reveal nerve or muscle dysfunction with a high degree of specificity4. However, these techniques require specialised personnel, they are time-consuming and they do not allow diagnosis of small intra-epidermal nerve fiber pathology5. Conventional NCS-EMG may require up to 90 minutes to be completed4. Considering the high prevalence of ICU-acquired neuromuscular disorders, it is unrealistic for conventional NCS-EMG to be used as a large-scale screening tool.Electrophysiological investigations of peripheral nerves and muscles offer several advantages. They are minimally invasive and easily repeatable, they can be performed at the bedside and the results are immediately available6. Electrophysiological alterations indicating CIP or CIM can also be demonstrated in non-collaborative patients. In comatose patients or in those with persisting sedation or septic encephalopathy who develop severe muscle weakness or paralysis after ICU admission, electrophysiological investigations can be performed to avoid unreasonably pessimistic prognosis by identification of CIP or CIM as the cause7. Electrophysiological alterations are not only essential to establish the diagnosis of CIP and CIM, but they also have an earlier onset than clinical signs or they can be documented at an earlier stage7–11, thus offering the advantage of a timely diagnosis and the opportunity to conduct potentially valuable interventions before structural muscle-nerve alterations become established4. CMAP reduction is an early event which precedes clinical signs: its onset can be abrupt within 24 hours of normal findings10, and it can be observed as early as 48 hours before clinical signs in patients with sepsis12. Moreover, NCS may also be useful to predict hospital mortality9, and short13 and long-term morbidity8,14,15. CMAP after direct muscle stimulation (dmCMAP) may precede the development of ICU-acquired weakness by several days11. Therefore there is a need for a rapid, simple, accurate and valid electrophysiological test to identify CIP and CIM early in ICU.In a previous study called CRIMYNE10, we found that a simplified electrophysiological investigation, the peroneal nerve electrophysiological test (PENT), had high sensitivity (100%) and moderate specificity (67%) in identifying patients with a diagnosis of CIP or CIM using complete NCS as the reference diagnostic standard. However, the CRIMYNE study had methodological limitations that precluded the acceptance of PENT as a valid screening test in the ICU. Specifically, patients underwent complete NCS only if the PENT was abnormal, thus precluding the possibility of accurately detecting false negative results. Moreover, NCS assessors were not blind to the results of PENT. According to the STARD Statement for reporting studies of diagnostics accuracy, knowledge of the results of the index test can influence the reading of the reference standard, and vice versa. Such knowledge is likely to increase the agreement between results of the index test and those of the reference standard, leading to inflated measures of diagnostic accuracy16.The accuracy of new diagnostic tests should be evaluated before their introduction into clinical practice, because invalid tests may yield exaggerated and biased results, which may trigger their premature adoption in clinical practice and lead to test overuse, increasing patient risks and costs, or to test underuse, missing opportunities to improve health17,18. Test validation involves comparing the new test with a reference standard, defined as the best available method for establishing the presence or absence of the condition of interest17. Therefore, we designed the multicentre CRIMYNE-2 study according to rigorous methodology to provide an unbiased evaluation of the accuracy of PENT in diagnosing electrophysiologically-proven CIP and CIM diagnosed using complete NCS-EMG as the reference standard.","22 Aug 2014","Approved","Werner J.

Understanding protein homology within such huge sets of sequences requires tracing the divergence by mutation, substitution, insertion and deletion of residues1,2. Homologous proteins reflect similarity at sequence and structural levels, implying functional similarity3. This level of similarity broadens into the superfamily and the ways to deduce such relationships differ for both protein sequence and structure information4,5. There are different databases that organize sets of homologous proteins or protein superfamilies based on protein sequence and structure. These databases primarily employ protein domain information present in a sequence or structure. SCOP is a database that organizes the protein structural domain data in different hierarchical levels based on structural and functional information6. Many sequence search strategies use SCOP domains as a starting point for homology detection, focusing mainly at the superfamily level7,8. Structure-based classification is helpful to explore sequence space and helps in functional assignments by association of protein sequences9.Of the several methods developed for protein homology detection, the popular BLAST10 algorithm uses heuristics to search sequences and is able to detect close homologues, but fails in a few instances to establish relationships between distantly related proteins. To detect remote homologues, several methods such as, PSI-BLAST10 based on profiles, Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based methods like HMMSEARCH and Jackhmmer11,12, pattern-based methods like PHI-BLAST13, intermediate sequence search methods such as Cascade PSI-BLAST14 and phylogenetic tree based searches like Treesearch15 have been developed. Methods such as CHASE incorporate some of the above methods in a combined manner to reinforce the sequence search16. Each of the above methods can be optimized for better performance by customizing their parameters and the way they are implemented for sequence searches. For instance, PSI-BLAST is an iterative PSSM (Position Specific Scoring Matrix)-based remote homology detection method. In Cascade PSI-BLAST the search is iterated for several generations in a cascaded manner to improve remote homology detection14. It is important to select appropriate start points for sequence searches, especially for protein families and superfamilies, as different start points can result in different coverage. Park and co-workers have shown that remote homology detection is enhanced threefold for a set of related sequences in the form of a profile than merely searching with a single sequence as a query17. Anand and co-workers emphasized the use of multiple PSSMs as better detectors of remote homologues compared to a single query18. Thus, a search strategy can be designed to improve remote homology detection by choosing appropriate method(s) and starting point(s) for the search and by further optimizing the parameters.We have considered multi-member superfamilies from the PASS2 database19. PASS2 is a database of structural alignments of protein domains in a SCOP superfamily which share less than 40% mutual sequence identity. The strategy lies in using all the members of PASS2 superfamily, i.e., multiple members, and searching against the NR-Db (Non Redundant Database) available at the NCBI protein resource. We present our analysis based on a multiple query approach (MQ) for PSI-BLAST and PHI-BLAST. While using PHI-BLAST, for each query we obtain a set of patterns to initiate multiple searches per query, thereby adding an extra dimension for multiple patterns. The search approaches are evaluated at different coverage levels and a comparison of the two approaches using the two methods is presented. The methods are then applied to the entire PASS2 database.","28 Jul 2014","Approved","Saikat Chakrabarti, Structural Biology & Bio-Informatics Division, Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, India","Author Response 11 Jun 2014"," The authors have successfully addressed most of the questions raised during the review of version 1.

The development of ascites heralds a vulnerable time of sharply increased mortality for patients with liver disease – related in large part to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP)2,3. SBP is an infection of the ascitic fluid that occurs in 10–30% of patients with ascites4. Fatal in as many as 32.6% of cases, SBP can have a profound effect on the tenuous hemodynamics of patients with cirrhosis5. Exacerbating the arterial underfilling resulting from the splanchnic vasodilation of cirrhosis, SBP may lead to a decrease in cardiac output such that it can no longer satisfy the needs of a kidney that is already vasoconstricted6. The result is the hepatorenal syndrome which is often devastating. SBP with renal injury is fatal in 42% of patients7.SBP is caused by translocation of gastrointestinal organisms into the ascitic fluid, most commonly Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. As such, third generation cephalosporins are amongst the best studied antibiotics in this setting, with ceftriaxone as the drug of choice where cefotaxime is not available. Studied as a treatment for SBP in clinical trials for 25 years, the doses employed have been either 1 g every 12 hours or 2 g every 24 hours given intravenously for 5 to 10 day courses8–14.At our center, we have found that ceftriaxone is often given at 1 g daily either in reference to online resources from other major teaching institutions or because 1 g is the general preset dose for this antibiotic as generated by the electronic ordering system15.

The outcomes of SBP as a function of ceftriaxone dosage – 1 g daily versus 2 g daily – have never been evaluated. It is unknown what effect the dosage of ceftriaxone has on the control of SBP or on mortality. Neither the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) nor the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) guidelines on SBP management explicitly comment on the dosing of ceftriaxone for this indication16,17.Herein we present the results of a retrospective review of the outcomes of SBP stratified by dose of ceftriaxone.

It was recently suggested that, in addition to deformation forces, microdamage plays an important role in regulating bone turnover and strength3. Bone is restructured through the coordinated action of bone cells, osteoblasts responsible for bone formation and osteoclasts responsible for bone resorption. Cells of osteoblastic origin, including osteoblasts, osteocytes and bone lining cells are believed to act as mechanosensors in bone tissue1,4. Understanding how bone cells sense and react to mechanical forces is important for gaining insight into the mechanisms of bone adaptation to its mechanical environment.Because of the complexity of the bone environment in vivo, several models have been developed to understand the effects of mechanical stimulation on bone cells in vitro5. These models include application of hydrostatic pressure, longitudinal substrate stretch and fluid shear. These studies have established that osteoblastic cells can sense mechanical stimulation through plasma membrane receptors, stretch activated ion channels, as well as focal adhesion sites6. Ca2+ signaling was shown to be the prominent first response of osteoblastic cells to any type of mechanical stimulation7–9. Ca2+ signaling induced by mechanical stimulation in turn influences numerous bone cell functions such as cytoskeletal reorganization7, gene expression10, proliferation and differentiation6. However, these studies also identified significant complex signaling interactions between multiple cells6, making it difficult to de-convolute the responses of single cells to mechanical stimulation. Moreover, these techniques do not allow exact control of forces applied to individual cells, nor do they report single cell micro-injury.Local indentation techniques allow characterization of the response to mechanical stimulation at the single-cell level. Pipette microinjection11, pipette suction11–13, and atomic force microscopy (AFM)14,15 have been used to study responses of individual osteoblasts to mechanical stimulation. From these techniques, only AFM allows application of precisely controlled forces in the nano-Newton scale, as well as provides readout of the extent of membrane deformation16. Moreover, AFM can be used with cantilever tips of different geometries, which allow additional control of the distribution of the force. Spherical tip allows creating high range of membrane strains17, while pyramidal tip allows reversible membrane penetration, which does not result in long-term cell damage18,19.The goal of this study was to examine how a single osteoblastic cell responds to forces inducing cell membrane deformation only, or membrane deformation resulting in micro-injury. We used either primary bone marrow cells cultured with ascorbic acid, or C2C12 cells stably transfected with bone morphogenic protein (BMP) 2. C2C12 cells have been shown to undergo osteoblastic differentiation when treated with BMP-220. Mechanical forces of different magnitude were applied using AFM. To monitor cell responsiveness to mechanical forces, changes in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) were assessed.","03 Sep 2014","Approved","Daniel Isabey, Cell and Respitory Biomechanics, French Institute of Health and Medical Research, France",NA," The article by Lopez-Ayon et al. compares the calcium (Ca2+) response of osteoblasts to mechanical forces resulting from 2 types of well-defined micro-damages, namely a local membrane deformation and a micro-injury. An atomic force microscope is advantageously used to control and modulate these 2 types of stretching effects. In its present form, the article is already well structured, rich in new experimental results and easy to read. However, their message would be more complete if authors were considering the following points. Major comments Concerning methodological aspects:Since the probe calibration is very important for AFM measurements, authors should provide more details concerning this indispensable step. For instance, the method used to determine the spring constant of the probe is never mentioned. There is a non negligible hydro-drag force applied to the cantilever when it is moved at speed of 20 µm/s. If this aspect is not taken into account, the effective forces applied to cells and the energy spent to deform the membrane may be overestimated. A comment should be provided concerning this point. The method used to quantify the Ca2+ concentration is based on the analysis of averaged intensity in a predetermined zone drawn on the images acquired by fluorescent microscopy. So, signal intensity could depend on the layer which is in focus. The increase in intensity might thus be to the fact that cell is locally compressed leading to the generation of a calcium flow toward the basal cell face which is in focus. This additional effect should be appropriately discussed.  Concerning Results and Discussion:The authors write in page 4 that: ""When consecutive low load indentation were performed at the same location on the same cell multiple local responses were induced"". This results is indeed comforted by the calcium concentration images shown at 6 s in Fig 2B. Multiple calcium spots are visible at 6 s on the non magnified cellular image, suggesting that a local mechanical effect may induce multiple (and durable) distant yet local effects. Such a mechanically induced signaling at a distance has been largely described and commented by the group of Ning Wang presently working at University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign (e.g., Wang et al., 2009). Clearly a tensed cytoskeleton plays a key role in such a distant phenomena and using, e.g., cytochalasin D, would have been of interest to prove that the distant local effects are related to the tensed cytoskeleton. Authors should at least comment on this interesting result revealed by the local membrane deformation test. Such an distant effect is not so evident in case of membrane rupture suggesting (since mechanical effect become global) important modifications for the cytoskeleton between the two types of stress studied. These distant effects could advantageously be analyzed and quantified. It is not clear whether the cells are tested in isolated conditions (like in Fig 2B) or with some degree of confluence (like in Fig 2E)... In the latter case, mechano-chemical interactions between cells could play a role in calcium signaling. This point should be clarified all along the paper. Detailed commentsFigures 1A, 1B seem to show the culture at higher confluence than 50-70% as used for experiments. The linear fits in Fig. 5 A, B, C  don't represent the decay of peaks.

The majority of these used d-phenothrin as the active substance in a variety of dosage forms1. In 1997 a phenothrin mousse was developed based on a concept developed in Australia using natural pyrethrum2. The aim of the new product was designed to be more manageable during application and thus gain greater consumer acceptability than existing preparations. Laboratory studies of phenothrin lotion had indicated a high level of activity for the insecticide, so theoretically it could be incorporated into a formulation requiring a shorter application time1. However, at this time there was increasing evidence of insecticide resistance in several areas of the UK3,4, in parallel with a renewed consumer interest for treating head louse infestation by combing, either as the principal measure or as a component of conventional insecticide treatment. At the time of the study the most widely promoted combing method was “Bug-Busting” (Community Hygiene Concern, London), which used a fine toothed plastic comb for wet combing with conditioner, repeated at 3–4 day intervals for 2 weeks. It suggested the first combing could remove all lice so only newly hatched nymphs would be found during subsequent combing sessions before they could mature and lay eggs5. Before our investigation only two studies of wet-combing had been conducted. In one Bug-Busting was half as effective as two applications of malathion lotion6. A second found it more effective than permethrin creme rinse, but the dropout rate from both treatments made the interpretation of the results difficult7.We performed a pragmatic, observer blinded, three armed clinical trial analysed by intention to treat, comparing single applications of 0.5% d-phenothrin mousse or 0.2% d-phenothrin lotion with the Bug-Busting protocol of wet-combing with conditioner. The study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of each treatment when in use by the public.","28 Aug 2014","Approved","Maria Inés Picollo, Centro de Investigaciones de Plagas e Insecticisas, Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas (CONICET), Argentina","Author Response 22 Jul 2014"," This is an interesting clinical study to assess the comparative effectiveness of three head louse treatments when are used by the public. For this purpose, the treatments selected were 0.5% d-phenothrin mousse, 0.2% d-phenothrin lotion, and wet-combing with conditioner. The commercial products were applied according to manufacturer's instructions (30 minutes for 0,5% phenothrin mousse and 2 hours for 0,2% phenothrin lotion), and wet-combing according to the  Bug-Busting Community Hygiene Concern, London (fine toothed plastic comb with conditioner, repeated at 3–4 day intervals for 2 weeks).I consider that the manuscript is within the scope of the journal, the abstract is according to the objectives and results of the manuscript: The methodology, results and discussion are carefully written and adequate to the objectives of the study.One of the relevant aspects of the work is that reinforces the need for the effectiveness of commercial products must be warranted by the health authorities, due to the importance of pediculosis in school-aged children both in developed and developing countries. An unexpected and surprising result is the low effectiveness of the three methods evaluated. Although pyrethroid resistance and inadequate formulation of the active ingredients surely contribute to the low effectiveness of the phenothrin-based formulations (20% and 21,5% success for mousse and lotion respectively), the low effectiveness of wet-combing (19,15 success) has not been previously reported. This result is worrying considering that the use of a fine comb for removing lice and nits was proposed as a relevant tool both in the diagnosis of infestations and as part of an integrated control strategy of head lice. I agree with the authors in their first conclusion about the limitations of laboratory tests: ¨bioassay tests conducted in a laboratory, whether using laboratory reared insects or even wild collected ones, can only be indicative of efficacy for a formulation and it is unknown for a treatment to perform poorly in vitro yet be effective in vivo. ….. even ex vivo screens, using insects recently collected from the wild, may be only partially representative and several replicate tests should be performed using insects from geographically separated locations to ensure that the outcome is not obtained either by chance or due to some happenstance of physiological difference in the insects from that location¨. But as the authors surely know and probably should clarify in the paper, the main purpose of laboratory testing is the ¨comparative-evaluation¨ of the effectiveness of pure compounds or formulations. Thus, the parallel and simultaneous evaluation of different compounds and/or formulations made <U+200B><U+200B>in standardized conditions, is a reliable result of the comparative activity of the products evaluated.Obviously laboratory tests are faster and cheaper than clinical trials, and represent an excellent tool for a first selection of the compound or product to be developed (a pure compound without pediculicide activity in laboratory tests, will not be effective in a clinical trial).

To make scientific progress, Platt (Platt, 1964) emphasized defining at least two distinct hypotheses and then designing an experiment with the power to clearly distinguish between these hypotheses. By so doing, at least one of the hypotheses must then be rejected; the rejection marks a stepping-stone in science. If a hypothesis is not rejected then it remains as a potential working hypothesis, the target of further experimentation that eventually will lead to its rejection or improvement.The virtue of the mathematically-defined hypothesis is that it is clear and precise, and therefore susceptible to contradiction. Arguably, one should use mathematical “in numero experimentation” to define the critical laboratory experiment. Given that the experiment tests whether or not the working hypothesis is compatible with experimental data, then failure to fit the data within a defined level of goodness of fit leads to skepticism about the accuracy of the data or more often, about the structure of the model and leads to its modification or to its outright rejection. Revision of the conjecture follows: science is advanced.The hypothesis testing cycle is an iterative procedure: design hypothesis (and alternative hypotheses) <U+2192> execute experiment <U+2192> evaluate goodness of fit of model to data <U+2192> either reject the hypothesis and restart, or, alternatively, <U+2192> accept the model as the current working hypothesis and assess the parameters for the specific situation. The working model serves as the current belief until deeper thinking leads to an alternative hypothesis and one restarts the cycle. This philosophical and procedural point of view, more or less guaranteed to make efficient progress in the field, creates definable results step by step, and gives investigators a sense of satisfactory success.As in physics, models are posed in order to gain deeper understanding and to make predictions. The more realistic the model, the more accurate the prediction. Cause-and-effect models of biological systems are usually deterministic; they are fundamentally different from observationally-based probabilistic associations. The desire is to represent sequences of operations within a dynamic system leading to, and explaining, the observed data (Coatrieux & Bassingthwaighte, 2006; Bassingthwaighte et al., 2006a). Standard statistical methods are not central to deciding whether or not to reject the hypothesis, but are indeed helpful in assessing goodness of fit, estimating confidence ranges and co-variances among parameters, and in guiding the investigator in identifying errors or in finding ways to simplify the model.Over the years we have developed sets of tools to serve these processes. In this article we describe the features of a simulation analysis system, JSim; it is the product of evolutionary improvements in the hypothesis testing cycle. The central goals are to facilitate attempts to fit models to data, and to support the efficient development of computational models that describe and explain the behavior of biological systems (Bassingthwaighte & Goresky, 1984; Bassingthwaighte et al., 2005; Beard et al., 2005).Our perspective is embedded in JSim: it is an open-source simulation analysis platform, freely downloadable, running on Linux, Macintosh, and Windows, providing tools for the steps in the modeling analysis of data.

Continue reading “The authors touch briefly on reuse of existing models/projects and the use of a CVS repository to archive the history of model development, as well as the discussion on modular modelling in the future developments section. The basis for this modularity and reuse seems to result in the development of a new, monolithic MML document for the assembled model. It might be useful to see if there are features in either JSim or MML that allow dynamic links to the source modules to be maintained allowing users to alternate sources or versions of the source modules (rather than the cut-and-paste style described in the manuscript).”We agree that JSim and MML modularity could be improved. We are currently in the design stages of a more modular form of MML that moves away from the current monolithic approach.  Design goals for the new MML include the following: the ability to draw upon and reuse code modules stored either in a project file or in a permanent archived location on-line; support for the recently developed SBML ""Hierarchical Model Composition"" package; support for support for CellML v1.1 modular structuring; support for structured multiple reuse on modules (e.g. support of multiple parallel pathways); support for run-time switching of alternative modules; compatibility with existing MML models. However, we feel this work is not yet far enough along for public presentation. “ In addition to the versioning of the JSim input data (experimental data, MML, projects, etc.), it is often the case that a specific piece of work requires some minimum version of the software itself.

The vast majority of the time, JSim runs correctly on projects created by different JSim versions.  The only difference will be that, when running an older JSim version, the latest features will not be available.  There are three primary reasons why this is the case.  First, the basic functionality of JSim and project file structure has been stable for many years.  Second, the XML structure of project files allows old versions of JSim to ignore features in newer project files.  Third, a version number tag in each project file allows newer versions of JSim to migrate old projects to the new format. Occasionally, an NSR modeler discovers a JSim bug that must be fixed for proper operation.  Release of that model will be delayed until a new version of JSim is released.  In that case, our best practices recommendation is to note the minimum JSim version required to run the model on the relevant web page.  For published papers, where it is important to reproduce figures ""warts and all"", it is recommended that the papers list the version of JSim used to produce the results. Based on your comment, we discussed the possibility of making the JSim project version for each model more visible on our site.  The consensus was that, given the generally high level of compatibility, this information would be mostly misleading to users by assigning anundeserved level of attention to the version number. “The manuscript would benefit from a more thorough comparison of JSim to alternative tools, or at least some links to specific tools being contrasted in the article.”We've added a new section ""Some Alternative Simulation Platforms"" (page 18) that briefly discusses some alternative simulation platforms to JSim.  Given the large number of available products (over 250 SBML-based products alone) the list is not exhaustive.  Platforms mentioned are Virtual Cell, COPASI, roadRunner, Chaste, PCenv, COR, OpenCell, OpenCOR and Continuity.  Given limited space, the descriptions of these programs are not complete nor is there a feature-to-feature comparison with JSim.  Such a comparison, evaluating available mathematical methods, features, portability, usability, performance and scientific reproducibility would be a good idea for a follow-on paper tothis one. “There is no description of how spatial geometries (finite element meshes or finite difference grids) are defined in JSim.

In this kingdom, the GC content varies from 20% to 70% of the genome and this large variation has been documented in a number of reports that have aimed to explain it1–3. The amino acid compositions are also different in eubacterial proteomes due to the variation of GC content4. It has been reported that these difference of amino acid compositions alter the characteristics of proteomes and as a consequence, proteins of GC-poor genomes are more prone to misfolding and aggregation compare to GC-rich genomes5,6. It has been hypothesized that GroEL plays a major role, if not an essential role, in the evolution of GC-poor organisms by buffering deleterious mutations that are fixed due to population bottlenecks7–9. This has been supported by the observation that many of the small GC-poor endosymbionts tend to overexpress GroEL10–12.However, the proposed chaperone dependence of GC-poor organisms does not explain why some of the GC-poor endosymbionts of the mycoplasma group have lost the groEL copy from their genome13. It is notable that these are the only known eubacterial organisms to have lost this gene. This observation led us to test the proposed relationship of GC poorness of genome with the aggregation propensity of the encoded proteome.Obtaining information on the aggregation propensity of proteins from different organisms is a challenging task. However, there has already been a careful characterization of the aggregation propensity of different Escherichia coli proteins that was conducted in a high-throughput manner14–16. Kerner et al. classified the GroEL substrates into Class I, II or III based on the interaction strength and on the stringency of their requirement for GroEL. Class III (C3) substrates were completely dependent on GroEL for folding, whereas Class II (C2) substrates were partially dependent. Class I (C1) proteins interacted weakly with GroEL and were able to fold spontaneously. In a trivial approach, homologs of GroEL-dependent proteins may be identified in other organisms13,17. This approach however fails to predict the evolution of protein dependence on GroEL correctly, as the sequence differences between species have the potential to introduce or remove kinetic traps from folding pathways, thereby altering their dependence on GroEL. In addition to the solubility of the E. coli proteome in a chaperone-free system, substrates of another chaperone DnaK were also identified by two independent research groups18,19. Applications developed primarily on machine learning algorithms to classify soluble or GroEL substrates16,18,20–24 are already available. However, these classifiers have not been trained with curated data prepared from multiple experimental results14,15,18,19. In this study, we have constructed a more reliable training dataset to build classifiers to determine the aggregation propensity and GroEL dependency in 1132 eubacterial proteomes, based solely on the amino acid sequences. We show a distinct trend in the aggregation propensity of proteins of an organism in relation to the GC content. Surprisingly, aggregation propensity decreased with lower GC content independent of symbiotic characteristics, suggesting that GC-poor organisms have indeed evolved a proteome that is devoid of aggregation-prone proteins.","01 Oct 2014","Approved","Annalisa Pastore, MRC National Institute for Medical Research, UK",NA," The genesis of this paper is the proposal that genomes containing a poor percentage of guanosine and cytosine (GC) nucleotide pairs lead to proteomes more prone to aggregation than those encoded by GC-rich genomes. As a consequence these organisms are also more dependent on the protein folding machinery. If true, this interesting hypothesis could establish a direct link between the tendency to aggregate and the genomic code.In their paper, the authors have tested the hypothesis on the genomes of eubacteria using a genome-wide approach based on multiple machine learning models. Eubacteria are an interesting set of organisms which have an appreciably high variation in their nucleotide composition with the percentage of CG genetic material ranging from 20% to 70%. The authors classified different eubacterial proteomes in terms of their aggregation propensity and chaperone-dependence. For this purpose, new classifiers had to be developed which were based on carefully curated data. They took account for twenty-four different features among which are sequence patterns, the pseudo amino acid composition of phenylalanine, aspartic and glutamic acid, the distribution of positively charged amino acids, the FoldIndex score and the hydrophobicity. These classifiers seem to be altogether more accurate and robust than previous such parameters.The authors found that, contrary to what expected from the working hypothesis, which would predict a decrease in protein aggregation with an increase in GC richness, the aggregation propensity of proteomes increases with the GC content and thus the stability of the proteome against aggregation increases with the decrease in GC content. The work also established a direct correlation between GC-poor proteomes and a lower dependence on GroEL. The authors conclude by proposing that a decrease in eubacterial GC content may have been selected in organisms facing proteostasis problems. A way to test the overall results would be through in vitro evolution experiments aimed at testing whether adaptation to low GC content provide folding advantage.The main strengths of this paper is that it addresses an interesting and timely question, finds a novel solution based on a carefully selected set of rules, and provides a clear answer. As such this article represents an excellent and elegant bioinformatics genome-wide study which will almost certainly influence our thinking about protein aggregation and evolution. Some of the weaknesses are the not always easy readability of the text which establishes unclear logical links between concepts.Another possible criticism could be that, as any in silico study, it makes strong assumptions on the sequence features that lead to aggregation and strongly relies on the quality of the classifiers used. Even though the developed classifiers seem to be more robust than previous such parameters, they remain only overall indications which can only allow statistical considerations. It could of course be argued that this is good enough to reach meaningful conclusions in this specific case. I have read this submission. I believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard. Competing Interests: No competing interests were disclosed.

However, many of these successes are limited to the sites where they were originally developed in, a phenomenon referred to as “islands of excellence”. There are fewer examples of success that spread to the remainder of the system where the improvement was originally developed. “Spread” (or “scale-up”) is the science of taking a local improvement (e.g. the implementation of an intervention, the redesign of a process or system) that has produced a better result than the previous method, and actively disseminating it across a system1. There are many ways to “spread”, including, but not limited to, natural diffusion, extension agents, emergency mobilization, collaborative improvement, virtual collaborative methods, campaign spread, the wave-sequence approach, and hybrid models1–3. Notable examples of spread include the 100,000 Lives Campaign of the Institute of Health Care Improvement; the Quality Assurance Project (QAP) in Russia, which was funded by the United States (US) Agency for International Development (USAID); the USAID Health Care Improvement Project (HCI) in Afghanistan4, and the Project Fives Alive! in Ghana5, which was funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. This article focuses on only one of these approaches: the wave-sequence spread approach. It also discusses the associated concept of the “slice” of a system and describes a phenomenon related to the rate of adoption that we are seeing in the wave-sequence approach.","30 Jun 2014","Approved","Marie Schall, Institute for Healthcare Improvement, USA","Author Response (Member of the F1000 Faculty) 17 Jun 2014"," This article provides important detail about the application of the wave approach to spreading improvements and makes an important contribution to the science of achieving results at scale. I have several specific observations and suggestions for ways to strengthen the paper: Abstract:I suggest that the abstract briefly describes the “phenomenon” that you refer to in the last sentence….I believe this refers to the accelerated pace of the adoption of the changes in each successive wave. Introduction:The definition of spread given in the introduction refers to spread and “scale-up” as being the same concept.  Is there a rationale for using one term rather than the other?  For most of the paper the term spread is used but there are places later in the paper where the term “scale-up” is used instead.  I’d suggest keeping the language consistent throughout the paper unless there is a reason to use one term versus the other….and to explain that rationale. The wave-sequence approach section:The first sentence in this section needs to reflect a more precise definition of the wave-sequence approach.  Describing it as a “type of spread that focuses on spreading improved care delivery to other parts of the system” can be used to describe other spread approaches as well.  Introducing the essential components of the wave-sequence approach in the opening sentence would help to distinguish it from the other approaches described in the introduction.   The “Slice of a System” concept:It would be helpful to give more detail about the composition of the teams in the “wave” and what position/affiliation do the members who become change agents hold. For example, if the selected change agent is a point-of-care provider how do they continue in their provider role while at the same time functioning as a “change agent.”  It would be helpful to give more detail about how the team reflects the infrastructural components of the slice. Russia:The outcomes of the work are described briefly in the opening paragraph.  Has this work been published elsewhere?  A more precise description of the results in the text is needed, perhaps referring to the timeframe in the graph.  I’d suggest replacing the words “within a couple of years” with the exact timeframe.   I suggest giving more detail about how the wave-sequence approach was applied in Russia.  For example, what exactly were the petals, what type of facilities made up the slices, and what was the composition of the collaborative teams in each wave?  This detail would help the reader understand the general description of the wave-sequence approach given in the earlier description of the wave-sequence approach. Afghanistan:A more detailed description of what exactly the “slice of the system” was in this example would also help to explain the general approach (as noted above). Were the different types of collaborative teams, i.e., provincial facility, provincial community and hospital teams, described for Afghanistan also used in Russia?  Were collaborative teams that involved representatives from each layer in the slice ever used? Did the redesign coordinate effort across these teams? If so, how was that coordination accomplished? The results for Afghanistan are at the process level, i.e., compliance with the protocols.  Are their outcome levels results? The Russia example showed the actual impact of the changes on neonatal outcomes.  This type of data would strengthen the case example.  Conclusion:In a subsequent paper I would be interested to hear more about the “managerial and policy level changes” that were made. A greater understanding of these infrastructure changes often plays a key role in the success of large-scale improvement efforts. I have read this submission. I believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard. Competing Interests: No competing interests were disclosed.

The RNase H active site canonically consists of a highly conserved DED(D) motif (Figure 1), three to four carboxylate-containing residues collectively participating in the binding of catalytically required divalent cations, Mg2+ under physiological conditions. This active-site sequence motif and requirement for Mg2+ is widely shared with other nucleases, suggesting a common catalytic mechanism1.Figure 1. Conservation of the ribonuclease H active site.(A) Residue conservation among bacterial RNase H homologs mapped onto the structure of ecRNH (PDB ID 2RN2). Highly conserved residues are shown in red, highly variable residues in green, and sites with insufficient data in yellow. Image produced using ConSurf. (B) Electrostatic map of the solvent-accessible surface of ecRNH produced using APBS. Red represents regions of negative charge and blue represents regions of positive charge. The active-site residues are represented as sticks in both cases.The best-studied member of the RNase H family is the homolog from Escherichia coli (ecRNH), in which this active-site motif is represented as D10, E48, D70, and D1342 (Figure 2A). Measurements of the pKa values of the active-site residues indicate perturbed pKa values for D10 and D70 which normalize upon Mg2+ binding, clearly establishing these residues as critical for interaction with ions3. The pH optimum for the RNase H reaction in vitro is approximately 7.5–8.54, a value at which all active-site residues should be deprotonated3 and therefore accessible for ion binding.Figure 2. Conformational diversity of metal-ion interactions with ecRNH as determined by crystallography.In all cases the backbone and active-site sidechains from ecRNH in the absence of ion (PDB ID 2RN2) are shown in light blue for comparison. (A) Structural superposition of the four active-site residues in two structures of ecRNH in the absence of metal ions: 2RN2 (light blue) and 1RNH (dark blue). (B) Structural diversity of RNases H in complex with a single Mg2+ ion: ecRNH (1RDD), green; XMRV WT (4E89), dark cyan; XMRV <U+0394>C (3P1G), maroon; MoMLV <U+0394>C (2HB5), purple. The two deletion mutants (indicated as <U+0394>C) bind Mg2+ in slightly different positions than do their corresponding full-length proteins and both contain two alternate conformations for E48 and D134. (C) Comparison of Mg2+ and Mn2+ complexes: ecRNH with Mg2+ (1RDD), green; ecRNH with Mn2+ (1G15), orange; HIV RNase H domain with ecRNH helix C insertion with Mn2+ (3HYF), brown. (D) Structural diversity of RNases H in complex with substrate: Homo sapiens RNase H with Ca2+ ions (2QKK), brown; Bacillus halodurans RNase H with Mn2+ ions (1ZBI), dark green.Despite extensive study, the interaction of metal ions with the ecRNH active site is poorly understood. Activity has been reported in the presence of Mn2+ as well as the physiologically relevant Mg2+5. Significant differences have been observed between the protein’s interactions with Mg2+ and Mn2+. Co-crystallization studies of ecRNH with high concentrations of Mg2+ find a single bound metal ion6 (Figure 2B). By contrast, co-crystallization with Mn2+ reveals two bound ions, one associated with residues D10 and D134 (denoted the A site), and one associated with D10, E48, and D70 (denoted the B site)7 (Figure 2C); the B site is similar but not identical to the previously identified Mg2+ site. Single Mn2+ sites have been identified in the presence of mutations of E48 and/or D1348, both of which are dispensable for Mn2+-dependent activity9. Crystallographic studies of related RNases H from the archaeal extremophile Bacillus halodurans10 and from Homo sapiens11 in complex with substrate find two bound ions in the active site (Figure 2D).Experimental evidence from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies locates the area surrounding the active site as the region most susceptible to perturbation upon interaction with ions (Figure 3). Titration of Mg2+ with ecRNH, monitored independently by 1H and 25Mg2+ NMR, suggests that only a single ion binds to the protein in the absence of substrate5. The identified binding site has relatively weak affinity; Kd has been reported in the micromolar5 to low millimolar range12. The second site may be occupied only upon binding of substrate8, possibly due to the presence of high local concentration in the ion cloud of the highly negatively charged nucleic acid molecule. Conformational changes in the active site upon binding the first ion have been suggested as well, with the second site proposed as being responsible for the attenuation of activity at high ion concentrations13. Collectively, these results have been used to propose both a one-metal7,8,14 and a two-metal10,15,16 catalytic mechanism. Computational work using the quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) method applied to the Bacillus halodurans17–19 and Homo sapiens20 complexes generally supports the two-metal mechanism.Figure 3.

For this reason, inhibitors of retroviral RNase H domains, particularly that of HIV, have been widely reported15,22, although none to date have reached clinical use. Most such inhibitors interact with the active site in the metal-bound state22 and therefore must be selective for retroviral RNase H domains to find clinical utility. The HIV RNase H domain (hivRNH) has been reported to bind two metal ions even in the absence of substrate23, although the reason for this difference in behavior between hivRNH and ecRNH is not clear. The Homo sapiens RNase H domain (hsRNH) has not been structurally characterized in the absence of substrate and its binding behavior is less well understood. However, it has higher sequence identity and is more structurally similar to ecRNH than hivRNH.Combined nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and molecular dynamics (MD) studies of the behavior of the ecRNH active site residues suggest that the residues of the ecRNH active site are preorganized in the apo state for the binding of a single Mg2+ ion24. However, experimental constraints prevent the detailed observation of the protein’s dynamic behavior in the presence of a bound ion at ps-ns timescale. The present work aims to more fully understand the dynamics of ecRNH in the Mg2+-bound state through molecular dynamics simulations of ecRNH in the presence of single Mg2+ ions in various positions in the active site as suggested by crystallographic studies. In addition, the dynamic behavior of the active site in the apo state is compared with homologs from other organisms.","20 May 2014","Approved","Gaetano Montelione, Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Rutgers University, USA","Author Response 20 Jun 2014"," This is an exciting paper which beautifully demonstrates the value of MD simulations coupled with experimental data for understanding structure-dynamic-function mechanisms. The research appears to be carefully executed, with proper controls, and the paper is well written. Together with related papers (e.g, Stafford et al., JACS 2014 - ref 24) it would be an excellent topic paper in the area of protein structure and function for an undergraduate or graduate seminar course.  The results indicate that the apo state of Ec RNase H is conformationally preorganized to favor binding of magnesium ion. MD simulations suggest the primary Mg+2-binding site is actually the observed Mn+2 –binding site B. This is an interesting application of MD to assess the significance of various metal-binding sites previously observed in X-ray crystal structures. 13C nuclear relaxation measurements reveal no statistically significant differences in the fast-time-scale side-chain dynamics of DENQ residues for complexes with Mg+2 modelled into metal binding sites compared with apo Ec RNase H. However, these modelling results suggest some minor structural changes in the active site that may enhance subsequent substrate binding.  MD simulations from a phylogenetically diverse set of RNase H proteins, including representatives of bacterial, eukaryotic, and retroviral RNAses H, suggest that active sites that are conformationally-preorganized for metal binding are a common feature of the RNase H domain family. The work is suitable for publication in F1000Research but I do suggest minor revisions to address the following points:Fig. 1 shows strong conservation of active site residues among bacterial homogues, and Fig. 8 documents similarity in active site dynamics across a broad phylogenetic distribution, as characterized by MD simulations. The authors conclude that these dynamic properties are only subtly modulated by amino acid sequence and primarily imposed by the characteristic protein fold. As suggested by Reviewer 1 (Rafael Najmanovich), it would be helpful to document the active-site sequence variation across these homologs to support this conclusion. The authors state “all simulations were performed at a pH of 5.5 to recapitulate the conditions used in prior NMR experiments on ecRNH”. What is the pH optimum of enzyme function?  Is there any information about “physiological pH”. Based on the pKa’s of active site ionizable groups, how might the pH selected for this study impact the conclusions.

In addition to their conservation value, the Coral Triangle’s marine resources are a cornerstone of the region’s economies and societies, with millions of people dependent upon them as a daily source of food and income2. The health of these ecosystems is at severe risk due to destructive and over-fishing, coastal development, poor water quality, and climate change3.In 2009, the six Coral Triangle countries, supported by USAID and other external funders, embarked upon the Coral Triangle Initiative on Coral Reefs, Fisheries and Food Security (CTI-CFF), an unprecedented multilateral partnership to address threats to the region’s marine and coastal resources through accelerated and collaborative action. The CTI-CFF goals include the designation of priority seascapes, establishment of a Coral Triangle marine protected area (MPA) system, the protection of threatened species, coordinated action on climate adaptation, and implementation of an ecosystem approach to fisheries management4. As the initial five-year phase of the CTI-CFF came to a close in 2013, much has been accomplished, but much work remains if these goals are to be achieved5.Marine conservation planning is a systematic approach to developing spatial plans, primarily focused on conservation of biodiversity, habitats and ecological processes, while facilitating multiple uses of the marine environment and promoting, where possible, goals related to climate change, fisheries, and livelihoods. In the last three decades, conservation planning has evolved from an academic discipline to have considerable influence on conservation action around the world6. Yet, systematic approaches have had relatively little influence on conservation in the Coral Triangle – one region where they are needed most.Conservation planning faces particular challenges in the Coral Triangle. The marine, coastal, and small-island ecosystems that are the focus of the CTI-CFF comprise large-scale common pool resources, which are notoriously difficult to govern59. The Coral Triangle is characterised by extremely diverse political, economic, and cultural contexts, and conservation planning must therefore contend with a huge diversity of institutional settings, objectives and social and political actors operating at multiple levels and scales59. Nevertheless, whilst applications might be less straightforward than in simpler institutional settings, the potential benefits of conservation planning are substantial.Conservation planning provides benefits at both regional and local scales. Regional-scale planning is critical for achieving objectives that require broad perspectives and emergent properties7 that mean the whole (e.g. a system of MPAs) is greater than the sum of the parts (individual MPAs). Emergent properties are achieved through, for example, complementarity of ecosystems and species and connectivity between individual MPAs8,9. Systematic planning provides a transparent framework to ensure efficient use of limited resources, and offers a proactive alternative to reactive actions in the face of increasing threats to natural resources10,11. Importantly, systematic planning can be used to minimise conflict between conservation goals and the diverse aspirations of users of the marine environment12,13.The Coral Triangle has experienced rapid growth in the number of individual MPAs designated or initiated primarily by communities and local governments. Yet, despite the many benefits of local and community-led actions, few MPAs are effectively managed14 and, without coordination, they often fail to form functional conservation networks that achieve regional-scale objectives15–17. Systematic planning can inform strategic expansion of local actions to maximise their cumulative contribution towards regional-scale goals18,19, including the broad goals of the CTI-CFF.With the first phase of the CTI-CFF now complete, it is timely to explore challenges related to the effective implementation of conservation planning in the region, and how they might be overcome. To do so, we convened a focus group of conservation biologists, practitioners, policy makers, and donors working in the region (the authors). We first outlined a vision: of conservation planning applied throughout the Coral Triangle, at spatial scales ranging from local to region-wide, to effectively inform management actions implemented to achieve objectives for biodiversity, fisheries, and food security. We then considered constraints on this vision being realised, and sought to identify strategies to overcome the constraints.From an initial list of “things to get right”, we consolidated related topics, and excluded those that we considered either trivial or overly specific, to arrive at the final 10 (Table 1). We focussed specifically on challenges related to the uptake and application of conservation planning, as opposed to those facing conservation initiatives more generally. The topics that we discuss here are deliberately ambitious, and we do not claim either a complete analysis of these challenges or to provide solutions. Our aim is to highlight issues that have not been widely approached or discussed in the literature, which has focused primarily on technical aspects of MPA network design e.g.20. We acknowledge that the context for, and approaches to, conservation planning vary widely throughout the Coral Triangle. While some of the strategies we propose are being applied to some extent in parts of the region, and we highlight examples of these, without exception they are not being addressed effectively or extensively enough in the Coral Triangle, or indeed in many other regions. The overall goal of this paper is to contribute to the evolving agenda for marine conservation planning in the Coral Triangle by stimulating dialogue about these important and neglected topics.Table 1. Summary of ten things to get right for marine conservation planning to effectively inform management actions in the Coral Triangle.

typically     requires long time-framesReview the current legislative and     institutional environment at different     levels of government, to identify     appropriate entry points5.  Integrating

Decreasing fertility and increasing mortality are general hallmarks of aging that are typically accompanied by a declining activity level, altered metabolic rate, and a higher susceptibility to predation, parasites and disease3–5. Despite its ubiquity, patterns and rates of aging vary enormously among, and within species. A large body of theory and experiment explores the evolutionary causes of this diversity; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still poorly understood6,7.Evolutionary life history (LH) theory generally assumes that allocation of energy among the competing demands of growth, development, reproduction and somatic maintenance lead to functional trade-offs among these processes8,9. Consistent with this idea of resource allocation trade-offs, lifespan and fecundity are generally negatively correlated in comparisons among species8,10, A prominent exception to this pattern occurs in many social insects. In many ants, termites, and bees11, reproductive females are both long-lived and highly fecund relative to other species. For example, queen black garden ants (Lasius niger) can live for at least 28 years, while laying hundreds of eggs per day12, and queen honey bees (Apis mellifera) have a maximum lifespan of 3–5 years while laying thousands of eggs per day13. In contrast, most non-social insects have adult longevity of less than one year, and have lower fecundity than social insect queens14.Investigations in honey bees suggest that the Vitellogenin gene (Vg) produces a yolk protein precursor that is synthesized in the abdominal fat body and acts as an antioxidant and promotes longevity in queen bees15. Differential expression of Vg has also been associated with the differences in lifespan between different kinds of worker bees: higher expression is seen in ""winter bees"" which have a lifespan of 10 months to 1 year, and lower expression in ""summer bees"" with a lifespan of 30–50 days16–18. RNAi knockdown of Vg expression in workers resulted in lower oxidative stress resistance19 and shorter lifespan20. In contrast, RNAi knockdown of Vitellogenin-encoding genes in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans increased survival21 and the expression of genes with similar function in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster (yolk protein genes) is negatively correlated with lifespan22. The strong support for a role for Vg expression in regulating lifespan and fecundity in honey bees, combined with conflicting results from other species, led us to ask if honey bee Vg has different functional properties than its homologs in other invertebrates. Specifically, we asked (1) if transgenic expression of honey bee Vg in fruit flies can regulate lifespan or fecundity, and (2) if over-expression of a related gene that is endogenous in flies has effects similar that of expression of honey bee Vg.An extensive genetic toolbox allows time and tissue-specific manipulation of gene expression in D. melanogaster in ways that are not available in other organisms, and these techniques have been used to characterize the effects of many genes on fly lifespan and fecundity23. For example, manipulations of genes involved in the insulin signaling and the target-of-rapamycin pathways have been causally linked to lifespan regulation in flies (reviewed in23,24). To our knowledge, however, the effects of Vg-family genes on aging-related traits have not been investigated in flies. Unfortunately, D. melanogaster lacks a direct homolog of honeybee Vg. Instead, gene CG31150, recently annotated as crossveinless d (cv-d), encodes a Vg-like protein that is expressed mainly in the fat body25. The coding sequence for this gene is the most similar among all Drosophila genes to Vg-encoding genes in honey bee (37% similarity), C. elegans (40% similarity), chicken (38% similarity) and zebra fish (38% similar)26. CG31150 resembles other Vg family genes in having an N-terminal Vitellogenin N domain, DUF1943 Pfam motifs, and a partial von Willebrand Factor D (VWD) domain near the C terminus25. The biological functions of CG31150 are largely unknown, but it was recently implicated in lipid transport and bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signaling.We used the bipartite GAL4/UAS system to manipulate the expression of both honey bee Vg and the endogenous CG31150 gene in flies, and to assess the effects of these manipulations on fly lifespan and fecundity. In this system, expression of a transgene is under the control of a promoter region derived from yeast, the Upstream Activation Sequence (UAS). This promoter region activates transgene expression only when it is bound to the GAL4 protein. Tissue-specific promoters enable spatial control of GAL4 protein production27. Temporal control of transgene expression can be achieved in several ways28, but one of the most convenient methods is using constructs in which the GAL4 DNA binding domain is fused to a progesterone receptor transcriptional activation domain, and is therefore only activated by systemic application of a progesterone-receptor ligand29–31. We used RU486 (mifepristone)-induced GAL4 drivers (also called the GeneSwitch system) to manipulate our target genes in adult fat body32. A major advantage of this system is that control flies (not exposed to RU486) have exactly the same genotype as transgene-expressing flies, so genetic background differences cannot contribute to differences in phenotype33. We manipulated the expression of both the honey bee Vg and D. melanogaster CG31150 in order to determine whether either or both can regulate lifespan or fecundity in flies. We included two constructs of each gene to account for potential position effects. We also included a series of controls to take into account possible phenotypic effects of RU486 or of the expression of the GAL4 protein34,35.","24 Jun 2014","Approved","John Tower, Davis School of Gerontology and Department of Biological Sciences, University of Southern California, USA",NA," Previous reports of a positive correlation between Vg gene expression and longevity in the hymenoptera prompted this interesting and timely test of Vg gene over-expression in Drosophila. The data show that there is no simple strong benefit to life span when over-expressing Vg genes in the Drosophila adult fat body, using the S1-106 Gene-Switch driver strain. In addition, because a life span increase was observed in a control cross involving over-expression of GFP, the results suggest possible effects of the drug, the activated Gene-Switch transcription factor, the GFP, or the variability of the assay. These results underscore the importance of careful controls for possible life span effects on the conditional gene expression system itself, independent of the specific identity of the gene being over-expressed. The data are clearly presented and support the conclusions above, however, the generality of the conclusions must be tempered somewhat given the limited scope of the study.  In previous Drosophila studies life span extension was observed when transgenes were expressed with certain drivers, but not others, including some cases where the drivers tested had similar tissue specificities.  Those results indicate that the precise tissue-specificity and/or level of transgene expression can be important. In the present study the Vg transgenes were expressed using a Gene-Switch driver strain that yields expression in only a subset of the fat-body tissues, so it remains possible that over-expression of the Vg genes using a driver with more extensive expression pattern in the fat body and/or other tissues might create a life span increase.  The conclusions regarding the possible cause of the life span increase in the control cross are based on the assumption that over-expressed GFP has little or no phenotypic effect.  However the one Drosophila study cited reports a significant (negative) effect of GFP expression on aging phenotypes (using different drivers).  If GFP can have negative effects in some tissues it seems possible it might have positive effects when expressed in other tissues (for example, the “negative” effect of killing the IPCs or the germ cells can increase fly life span). For these reasons it is not clear whether the life span increase observed in the present study results from the drug, the activated Gene-Switch, or the GFP. Finally, it should be noted that this result was not replicated. These considerations limit the support for a possible negative life span effect of the Vg transgenes as suggested in the Abstract and Discussion.

There are large-scale efforts to catalog the results of this research in structured databases, including the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database1 and the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD)2. Much of the source information relevant to such efforts is available only from unstructured sources such as the scientific literature, and significant resources are expended in manually curating and structuring the information in the literature. As such, there have been a number of systems developed to target automatic extraction of mutations and other genetic variation from the literature using text mining tools3–9, inter alia. Such tools have been shown to perform well, benefiting from a well-defined target vocabulary (nucleic and amino acids), the availability of reference sequences for position validation, and increasing adoption of standard nomenclature such as the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) format10. The natural language descriptors of genetic variation are fairly consistent, and lend themselves well to automated processing.In previous work11,12, we assessed one of these tools, the Extractor of Mutations (EMU) tool6, for its ability to identify the genetic variant information that had been manually curated in the COSMIC13 and the International Society for Gastro-intestinal Hereditary Tumours (InSiGHT)14 databases from targeted literature sources. That work found very low recall for the text mining tool when considering the narrative content of publications alone, and identified processing of the supplementary material associated with publications as a critical component of an approach to automated genetic variant curation from the literature.In this work, we perform a broad survey of the existing publicly available tools for extraction of genetic variants from the scientific literature. We consider not just one tool but a number of different tools, individually and in combination, and apply the tools in two scenarios. First, they are compared in an intrinsic evaluation context, where the tools are tested for their ability to identify specific mentions of genetic variants in a corpus of manually annotated papers, the Variome corpus15. Unlike previous test corpora, this corpus was not designed exclusively for the purpose of testing mutation extraction tools and hence is a better test of real-world applicability than prior corpora. Second, they are compared in an extrinsic evaluation context based on our previous study with COSMIC and InSiGHT. Our results demonstrate that several of the tools have complementary coverage and can be used together effectively. This study suggests several directions for the improvement of text mining tools for genetic variant extraction from the literature.","23 Oct 2014","Approved","Max Haeussler, Department of Biomolecular Engineering, University of California Santa Cruz, USA","Author Response 20 May 2014"," Thank you for providing more parts of the data and parts of the code.I had asked for the pipeline, which includes the information on how you got from the input text to the final table.

Have I missed something?You probably find my comments and my interest in the pipeline too detailed, but I do not expect anyone to document the complete code. It would just be good to be able to reproduce your main table by either running a program or having a README file that tells me what to type to get the input text and how the software arrived at the main table from your paper. Anyone who publishes a mutation finder in the future has to benchmark it and you want them to use your table and rank themselves using your pipeline. Currently, to do this, I have the impression that readers will have to contact you and ask for more details.Is there any reason why you only provide data for the Variome corpus? It seems to me that to reproduce the table, one would need the data for all corpuses?I don't want to delay this manuscript further, and accept it as it is. I have read this submission. I believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard. Competing Interests: No competing interests were disclosed.

While it generates knowledge that has a value per se regardless of its possible practical outcome, it also delivers knowledge that has the potential to produce more practical benefits1,2. Basic biomedical research in particular is crucial in addressing the challenges we face in our highly interconnected planet in which communicable diseases spread quickly and in which non-communicable diseases cause the premature death of many individuals3.Historically, a wide range of basic biomedical research projects have contributed to the advancement of knowledge, from research solely inspired by the researcher’s curiosity to projects driven by a vision of how knowledge generated by research could be used as the basis for applied research. All research along this continuum is considered “basic” because it serves as the foundation for further research that may lead to applications. Scientific knowledge is produced by the coming together of all kinds of research streams and ideas. Abraham Flexner captured this aspect of science in the image of the Mississippi river, which “begins in a tiny rivulet in the distant forest. Gradually other streams swell its volume. And the roaring river that bursts the dikes is formed from countless sources4”. Although it often takes decades to develop, the applied outputs of knowledge advancement (e.g. drugs) have at their roots countless basic investigations2.Given its importance, complexity and breadth, basic research has been primarily funded by public money. This was particularly true in the decades that followed World War II during which basic research went through a “golden age,” being conducted primarily in research universities and paid for with public money5. Sadly, public expenditure for research has decreased since then and nowadays fundamental sciences are for the most part underfunded. Basic biomedical research currently receives less support than it received only a few years ago. For instance, in the United States, National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding has been nearly stationary since 2003 in the face of rapid expansion (as increased amount of research activity) of existing biomedical fields and the emergence of new ones1,6. One explanation of the low support for fundamental sciences is our cognitive bias in favor of immediate rewards. As our brains are structured in a way that leads us to unduly favor immediate rewards over future benefits7, we tend to underestimate the importance of human activities and initiatives with benefits that lie in the future8.Nowadays basic researchers are said to owe a moral duty to extract maximum transformative value (the potential to translate in novel and fruitful applied research) whenever their research is publicly funded9–11. The mindset has changed since the time when the isolation and self-referring of the scientific community was perceived in a positive way and when the concept of “scientific integrity” was equated with the concept of “social responsibility”12–14. Public support is no longer (or is much less) based on the myth of the “free play of free intellects”2,12,15 and the notion of “socially robust” knowledge has often replaced the notion of “reliable knowledge”16,17. Attention is now more often focused on whether public funding is used for socially beneficial activities11,18. An increasing number of scholars and opinion leaders are proposing the training of “civic scientists” and the engagement of scientists in the public discourse19–24. Specific policies have been designed with the purpose of increasing the practical output of basic academic research. For example, the Bayh-Dole Act gives US universities the possibility to own their own inventions but it also raises concerns as to whether the monetary incentives are too strong and therefore distract basic scientists from focusing on fundamental questions25,26. Funding agencies such as the NIH, in order to assess and increase the transformative value of research, require the discussion of the health benefit potential or (social) “significance” of proposed research when assigning resources. However, some scholars think that the current system of peer reviewing and grant assignment stifles creativity and innovation6,27.New strategies to successfully maximize the transformative value of basic research without compromising the nature of fundamental inquiries and the scientist’s creativity (and satisfaction) are needed. Softer incentives, not based on restrictive policies, which are often called by behavioral economists “nudges”28, seem particularly promising. If properly designed for basic research, nudges would slightly (and sometimes unperceivably) reorient some scientists in a certain direction without imposing rules or decreasing work satisfaction. However, these “nudges” can be designed well for basic research only if we have a good grasp of what motivates basic scientists, what their values are and the intellectual frameworks in which they operate so that soft incentives can be properly tailored. Studies on scientist’s views and values often focus on research misconduct29–31 or on particular issues of specific biomedical fields32–36. A few studies have collected feedback from scientists about social responsibility. Most of these studies were based on interviews and focus groups; in a few cases surveys were used to collect feedback about specific issues12,37–39. In this paper we expand upon the existing body of knowledge. We believe our study is the first based on a survey containing an extended set of multiple-choice and numerical questions aimed at quantitatively elucidating the motivations, values and opinions of a large group of basic researchers working in different fields of biomedicine. Data come from the responses of more than 300 basic scientists at Harvard Medical School and affiliated institutions in Boston and Cambridge, Massachusetts (USA). In this paper, we present the results of the survey and discuss how our findings can be used to increase the transformative value of basic biomedical research without decreasing the motivations and freedom of the scientists. We provide examples of specific nudges that might increase the social benefit without decreasing the “basic” nature of the scientific investigations.","17 Jun 2014","Approved","Daniel Strech, CELLS - Centre for Ethics and Law in the Life Science Institute for History, Ethics and Philosophy of Medicine, Hannover Medical School, Germany","Author Response 03 Jun 2014"," The revisions improved the paper.

Most cloud forest regions of the world, including the tropical Andes, are considered hotspots of biological diversity4, and plant species endemism often reaches high levels within cloud forest5,6. Epiphytes, non-parasitic plants that depend on other plants for support and are not in contact with terrestrial soil, are key components of cloud forest biodiversity and play critical roles in the hydrological and nutrient cycling of montane ecosystems. Not only can vascular epiphytes make up 30 percent or more of plant species diversity in tropical montane forests7, they also provide keystone resources for birds, insects, and other animals8–11. Through cloud stripping, epiphytes increase total moisture captured by forest canopies12–14, and are important in nutrient cycling15,16. Cloud immersion is important for many epiphyte species to maintain a positive water balance and avoid desiccation17; this makes them sensitive to changes in moisture regimes. Because of their sensitivity to moisture levels, epiphytes are considered indicator species in cloud forests for changing water balance conditions18, particularly those in the wet tropics19.On a typical tropical mountain, where temperature decreases with altitude, there is a gradient of increasing cloud incidence with altitude. Cloud formation is dependent on the vapor content of air and air temperature, both of which are predicted to change with global warming1. Atmospheric moisture levels are much less easily predicted than temperature in climate models, but a multi-model ensemble of climate simulations showed a trend towards drying in many tropical regions20. Climate model projections in the Andes include warmer temperatures and lower precipitation in the dry season21–23, which could place cloud forest plants under increased drought stress. Cloud base height is also predicted to rise, due to a combination of higher temperature and lower atmospheric moisture input by vegetation due to lowland deforestation and reduced transpiration because of increased atmospheric CO224–26. In Costa Rica, an increase in the elevation of cloud base has been demonstrated and has already lead to the extinction of cloud forest species27, although this may have been associated with a severe El Niño event in 1986–87 rather than a long term drying trend28.The sensitivity of vascular epiphytes to changes in cloud incidence was demonstrated experimentally in Monteverde, Costa Rica, where vascular epiphytes transplanted below the cloud base had shorter lifespans and higher leaf mortality29. It is not clear, however, whether this result can be generalized to continental cloud forests such as the eastern Andes. Cloud forests vary worldwide, with differences in cloud base height and the proportion of moisture received by the vegetation via cloud stripping versus rainfall30,31. Cloud forests near coastlines are heavily influenced by ocean conditions32, while cloud formation on continental mountain ranges is dependent on moisture flux across continents driven by synoptic weather patterns. Deforested areas in Costa Rica have fewer clouds than adjacent forested areas33, but simulations suggest that sea-surface temperature has a greater impact on lifting condensation level than deforestation34. Cloud forests in continental mountains like the Andes are expected to be more sensitive to conditions of the adjoining lowland ecosystems, particularly deforestation25,32. In addition, complex topography in the eastern Andes and its interaction with prevailing winds leads to wet and dry areas within regions broadly considered cloud forest35. Given the diversity of cloudiness and precipitation regimes that epiphytes as a group are exposed to, it is reasonable to expect that epiphytes may be adapted to local moisture regimes. For instance, epiphytes in lowland dry or seasonal forest have high desiccation tolerance36,37. Epiphytes in continental cloud forests like the Andes, which experience variable cloudiness regimes, may have more resistance to drought than those in locations with more stable cloud bases. Likewise, epiphytes growing at lower elevations, below the cloud base, may have greater drought tolerance than epiphytes growing above the cloud base.Beginning in the 2005 austral winter (June and July), we conducted a year-long reciprocal transplant experiment across an elevational gradient in cloud formation in the eastern Andes of southern Peru to test the effect that cloud immersion has on the performance of vascular epiphytes. The reciprocal transplant design also allowed us to distinguish between the effects of moving mats away from their home elevation versus moving plants into lower moisture conditions. This is a key control, not often made climate change transplant studies [e.g.29,38], for if epiphytes are locally adapted, reduced performance is expected if moved in any direction from their bioclimatic optimum. The specific questions we addressed were: (1) Does demographic performance decline when epiphytes are moved farther from their home elevation? (2) Is this effect greater when transplanted down-slope into drier and warmer conditions as predicted by results from Costa Rica?29We focused on three aspects of demographic performance, ramet survival, recruitment, and change in population size. Ramet survival allows us to examine treatment effects on existing individuals, while ramet recruitment and population change gives insight into treatment effects on epiphyte populations. We expected that ramet survival and recruitment would decrease and population change become negative as mats were moved farther from their home elevation. We also hypothesized that the decrease in ramet survival and recruitment would be greater for mats moved down-slope than for mats moved upslope if moisture level is the dominant factor in determining epiphyte species distributions.","21 Jul 2014","Approved","Liang Song, Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China","Author Response 23 May 2014"," The article ‘Epiphyte response to drought and experimental warming in an Andean cloud forest’ has been strongly improved in both form and content since the previous version.

Below we respond to these comments and describe the changes made to the paper in response. Dr. Song’s comments are in [brackets].[The time span of the experiment is only one year, which is too short.]While we agree that it would have been ideal to extend the study another year, this was not possible due to logistical constraints. Since the experiment was conducted in 2005-2006, it is not possible to add more time to the experiment. We now discuss the effect of experiment duration in the second paragraph of the Discussion. [Microclimatic data was not monitored in the three studied elevations during the experimental period - which may obscure the interpretation of the results.]We agree that microclimate data during the experiment would have been ideal. Sensors placed at the study site during the experiment stopped recording data soon after deployment. We therefore used data from another period. We added a sentence to the Discussion noting that microclimate data was not available during the period, but refer to rainfall data from the nearby Rocotal climate station. [There should be more species with different functional types, which could support the third hypothesis that different functional types (e.g. strap-leaf ferns, orchids, ericaceous shrubs) do not respond similarly to moisture gradients. If it is not possible for you to find enough species I would suggest not using ‘functional types’.]Since the experimental design focused on plots rather than individual species, we did not have control over the sample size for individual species. In this analysis we used the most abundant species in the plots, to maximize the statistical power to detect differences among treatments. We agree that this experimental design does not allow for a robust test of the hypothesis that functional types may differ in their response to moisture gradients. We therefore removed this hypothesis from the Introduction. However, we include the point in the Discussion, since the experiment does shed some light on differences among functional types, and we feel the patterns are worth mentioning. Title:[The title is well chosen although I would suggest adding the location where the study was conducted (e.g. “in the Andes cloud forest”). As noted by the authors, “Cloud forests vary worldwide, with differences in cloud base height and the proportion of moisture received by the vegetation via cloud stripping versus rainfall” and “High rainfall in this part of the Andes may mean that epiphytes here are less dependent on cloud immersion to maintain their water balance than their counterparts in other cloud forests.” -  This is not a general study concerned about all epiphytes, but a local study restricted to four typical vascular epiphytes in the Andes cloud forest.]Title changed to “Epiphyte response to drought and experimental warming in an Andean cloud forest”Abstract:[The abstract is basically well written, but the summary of the main findings do not seem appropriate. In the paper, the authors summarize that “Ramet mortality increased, recruitment decreased, and population size declined for epiphytes in mats transplanted down slope from the highest elevation, into warmer and drier conditions”, which is not strongly supported by the results. In the results, the authors mention that “Across all species, there were no significant effects on survival of any of the treatments for mats transplanted across elevations (Table 5 and Figure 2). For recruitment and population change, there was a significant interaction between source and transplant elevation (Table 5), with both positively associated with elevation for mats transplanted from 1500 and 1800 m, but negatively associated with altitude for mats from 1650 m (Figure 2).” Different epiphyte species and different parameters showed different response to treatments and sources. The results are much more complicated than what you summarized.]We’ve changed to state that epiphytes moved down slope from the highest elevation had stronger and more negative response than epiphytes moved from other elevations. This also addresses the next comment.[The authors mentioned that their reciprocal transplant design allowed them to distinguish between the effects of moving mats away from their home elevation versus moving plants into lower moisture conditions. As a key control, results concerned about the transplant effect should be included in the abstract. The authors mention biomass loss in the last sentence, but this conclusion was based on other studies (I guess it is based on Song’s results), not their own.]We revised the last sentence to focus on how the environmental and evolutionary context may affect epiphyte response to climate change.Introduction:[Paragraph 1: I suggest adding a sentence to illuminate why epiphytes are sensitive to water availability and temperature.]We added a clause to the sentence: “Cloud immersion is important for many epiphyte species to maintain a positive water balance and avoid desiccation” making it clear that: “this makes them sensitive to changes in moisture regimes.” In the next paragraph we describe how cloud formation and temperature are linked, and do not feel that it would add any clarity to the manuscript to repeat that here.[Paragraph 4: The authors mention “Do epiphyte species of different functional types (e.g. strap-leaf ferns, orchids, ericaceous shrubs) respond similarly to moisture gradients?” as one of the objectives of the study. If so, why were only four species studied? There is only one fern, one shrub, and two orchids in the experiment. It is not possible, in my opinion, to draw any useful conclusions of functional types with such a limited selection.]We deleted Question (3).[Paragraph 5: this paragraph is repeating much of the fourth paragraph, I suggest combining the two.]We deleted the last two sentences referring to functional types. The rest of the paragraph elaborates on the approach outlined in the preceding paragraph. We feel that for clarity it is useful to first describe the research questions generally, and then operationalize the general questions. For this reason, we first describe how we expect performance to change with treatments, and then, in the next paragraph, describe the specific performance metrics used, and more specific predictions of how we expected them to change.  We have therefore left the structure as is, with one general and one more specific paragraph. Materials and Methods:[The authors could provide a more detailed description of the four target genera, e.g., “What are the elevational ranges of the target genera in the Andes?” “What is the abundance of the four target genera at different elevations (1500m, 1650m, 1800m)?” etc. This information would be valuable to the interpretation of the results.]All of the genera have broad ranges in Peru, encompassing the study elevations. However, this information is less useful than the elevational distributions of the morpho-species sampled. We have added text in a new section (Focal species) of the Methods to point out more clearly the differences in abundance with elevation of the different target taxa. Table 2 gives the abundance of each the target morpho-species at each elevation.[Have the authors monitored the microclimatic data of the studied elevations during the experimental period? The details of this data are critical to the interpretation of the results yet it has not been included. Although the July climate for weather stations (Table 1) showed the general pattern of temperature and moisture level along the experimental altitudes it is not the microclimatic data of the study sites, especially as no data was provided at an elevation of 1650m.]Unfortunately, temperature and humidity sensors at the study site during the experiment stopped recording data soon after deployment, but this was not discovered until the end of the experiment. Therefore, microclimate data during the experiment is not available. Here we are reporting data for sensors deployed for a different study begun after the experiment that is the focus of this paper. We think this data is still useful, given that it is close to the experimental locations, and better than not reporting any climate data.[The time span of the experiment is only one year. Longer term monitoring (at least 2 years) at regular intervals (e.g. one year) would be much more valuable. In addition, I would suggest that the authors monitor other physiological parameters such as photosynthesis and chlorophyll fluorescence in their future work. Their conclusions would be much stronger based on these data.] While we agree that longer term monitoring would be ideal, this was not possible given logistical constraints. Here we are reporting what we did. We have added a sentence to the Discussion (2nd paragraph) stating that physiological measurements would be helpful.Discussion:[The title of the paper is “Epiphyte response to drought and experimental warming”; however, the authors do not mention warming in the discussion section. The authors should focus the discussion section more on how different epiphytes respond to drought and warming in this study rather than the reasons for the relative resistance of epiphytes to moisture stress.]We now mention temperature and moisture together in the first part of the Discussion, since it is not possible from our experimental design to separate the effects of each.[The authors overstate their results in some places. For example, they mentioned “Vascular epiphytes transplanted down slope from our highest elevation had lower demographic performance when transplanted to the lowest elevation” in the first sentence of the discussion section. This is only partly true for population change, while not true for survival and recruitment (Fig. 2). Although functional types are mentioned, the authors only have 4 species belonging to 3 functional types. ]This is a good point. We have changed the text to place less emphasis on functional types. We still mention differences in functional types as a potential factor in the species-level differences observed, but also include the caveat that our experimental design does not allow the rigorous testing of this hypothesis.[Paragraph 1: “In general, it appears that epiphytes responded to water stress but we also found evidence for local adaptation.” Both temperature and water availability changes along the elevations. Why are you sure that epiphytes responded to water stress not temperature?]Good point. See above.[Paragraph 2 and 3: Rainfall compensation and drought tolerance seems self-contradictory.]These two effects do act in opposite directions, but both are possible, and non-mutually exclusive. Rainfall compensation could be the usual rule, with occasional drought also providing a selective pressure. We now describe this more clearly at the end of section 1 of the Discussion.[PET: You should provide the full name when it appeared for the first time.]Thank you for catching this. Changed to potential evapotranspiration. We also deleted PET, since it only occurs once. We thank Dr. Song for the reviewing our paper and providing constructive feedback. Below we respond to these comments and describe the changes made to the paper in response. Dr. Song’s comments are in [brackets].[The time span of the experiment is only one year, which is too short.]While we agree that it would have been ideal to extend the study another year, this was not possible due to logistical constraints.

If it is not possible for you to find enough species I would suggest not using ‘functional types’.]Since the experimental design focused on plots rather than individual species, we did not have control over the sample size for individual species. In this analysis we used the most abundant species in the plots, to maximize the statistical power to detect differences among treatments. We agree that this experimental design does not allow for a robust test of the hypothesis that functional types may differ in their response to moisture gradients. We therefore removed this hypothesis from the Introduction. However, we include the point in the Discussion, since the experiment does shed some light on differences among functional types, and we feel the patterns are worth mentioning. Title:[The title is well chosen although I would suggest adding the location where the study was conducted (e.g. “in the Andes cloud forest”). As noted by the authors, “Cloud forests vary worldwide, with differences in cloud base height and the proportion of moisture received by the vegetation via cloud stripping versus rainfall” and “High rainfall in this part of the Andes may mean that epiphytes here are less dependent on cloud immersion to maintain their water balance than their counterparts in other cloud forests.” -  This is not a general study concerned about all epiphytes, but a local study restricted to four typical vascular epiphytes in the Andes cloud forest.]Title changed to “Epiphyte response to drought and experimental warming in an Andean cloud forest”Abstract:[The abstract is basically well written, but the summary of the main findings do not seem appropriate. In the paper, the authors summarize that “Ramet mortality increased, recruitment decreased, and population size declined for epiphytes in mats transplanted down slope from the highest elevation, into warmer and drier conditions”, which is not strongly supported by the results. In the results, the authors mention that “Across all species, there were no significant effects on survival of any of the treatments for mats transplanted across elevations (Table 5 and Figure 2). For recruitment and population change, there was a significant interaction between source and transplant elevation (Table 5), with both positively associated with elevation for mats transplanted from 1500 and 1800 m, but negatively associated with altitude for mats from 1650 m (Figure 2).” Different epiphyte species and different parameters showed different response to treatments and sources. The results are much more complicated than what you summarized.]We’ve changed to state that epiphytes moved down slope from the highest elevation had stronger and more negative response than epiphytes moved from other elevations. This also addresses the next comment.[The authors mentioned that their reciprocal transplant design allowed them to distinguish between the effects of moving mats away from their home elevation versus moving plants into lower moisture conditions. As a key control, results concerned about the transplant effect should be included in the abstract. The authors mention biomass loss in the last sentence, but this conclusion was based on other studies (I guess it is based on Song’s results), not their own.]We revised the last sentence to focus on how the environmental and evolutionary context may affect epiphyte response to climate change.Introduction:[Paragraph 1: I suggest adding a sentence to illuminate why epiphytes are sensitive to water availability and temperature.]We added a clause to the sentence: “Cloud immersion is important for many epiphyte species to maintain a positive water balance and avoid desiccation” making it clear that: “this makes them sensitive to changes in moisture regimes.” In the next paragraph we describe how cloud formation and temperature are linked, and do not feel that it would add any clarity to the manuscript to repeat that here.[Paragraph 4: The authors mention “Do epiphyte species of different functional types (e.g. strap-leaf ferns, orchids, ericaceous shrubs) respond similarly to moisture gradients?” as one of the objectives of the study. If so, why were only four species studied? There is only one fern, one shrub, and two orchids in the experiment. It is not possible, in my opinion, to draw any useful conclusions of functional types with such a limited selection.]We deleted Question (3).[Paragraph 5: this paragraph is repeating much of the fourth paragraph, I suggest combining the two.]We deleted the last two sentences referring to functional types. The rest of the paragraph elaborates on the approach outlined in the preceding paragraph. We feel that for clarity it is useful to first describe the research questions generally, and then operationalize the general questions. For this reason, we first describe how we expect performance to change with treatments, and then, in the next paragraph, describe the specific performance metrics used, and more specific predictions of how we expected them to change.  We have therefore left the structure as is, with one general and one more specific paragraph. Materials and Methods:[The authors could provide a more detailed description of the four target genera, e.g., “What are the elevational ranges of the target genera in the Andes?” “What is the abundance of the four target genera at different elevations (1500m, 1650m, 1800m)?” etc. This information would be valuable to the interpretation of the results.]All of the genera have broad ranges in Peru, encompassing the study elevations. However, this information is less useful than the elevational distributions of the morpho-species sampled. We have added text in a new section (Focal species) of the Methods to point out more clearly the differences in abundance with elevation of the different target taxa. Table 2 gives the abundance of each the target morpho-species at each elevation.[Have the authors monitored the microclimatic data of the studied elevations during the experimental period? The details of this data are critical to the interpretation of the results yet it has not been included. Although the July climate for weather stations (Table 1) showed the general pattern of temperature and moisture level along the experimental altitudes it is not the microclimatic data of the study sites, especially as no data was provided at an elevation of 1650m.]Unfortunately, temperature and humidity sensors at the study site during the experiment stopped recording data soon after deployment, but this was not discovered until the end of the experiment. Therefore, microclimate data during the experiment is not available. Here we are reporting data for sensors deployed for a different study begun after the experiment that is the focus of this paper. We think this data is still useful, given that it is close to the experimental locations, and better than not reporting any climate data.[The time span of the experiment is only one year. Longer term monitoring (at least 2 years) at regular intervals (e.g. one year) would be much more valuable. In addition, I would suggest that the authors monitor other physiological parameters such as photosynthesis and chlorophyll fluorescence in their future work. Their conclusions would be much stronger based on these data.] While we agree that longer term monitoring would be ideal, this was not possible given logistical constraints. Here we are reporting what we did. We have added a sentence to the Discussion (2nd paragraph) stating that physiological measurements would be helpful.Discussion:[The title of the paper is “Epiphyte response to drought and experimental warming”; however, the authors do not mention warming in the discussion section. The authors should focus the discussion section more on how different epiphytes respond to drought and warming in this study rather than the reasons for the relative resistance of epiphytes to moisture stress.]We now mention temperature and moisture together in the first part of the Discussion, since it is not possible from our experimental design to separate the effects of each.[The authors overstate their results in some places. For example, they mentioned “Vascular epiphytes transplanted down slope from our highest elevation had lower demographic performance when transplanted to the lowest elevation” in the first sentence of the discussion section. This is only partly true for population change, while not true for survival and recruitment (Fig. 2). Although functional types are mentioned, the authors only have 4 species belonging to 3 functional types. ]This is a good point. We have changed the text to place less emphasis on functional types. We still mention differences in functional types as a potential factor in the species-level differences observed, but also include the caveat that our experimental design does not allow the rigorous testing of this hypothesis.[Paragraph 1: “In general, it appears that epiphytes responded to water stress but we also found evidence for local adaptation.” Both temperature and water availability changes along the elevations. Why are you sure that epiphytes responded to water stress not temperature?]Good point. See above.[Paragraph 2 and 3: Rainfall compensation and drought tolerance seems self-contradictory.]These two effects do act in opposite directions, but both are possible, and non-mutually exclusive. Rainfall compensation could be the usual rule, with occasional drought also providing a selective pressure. We now describe this more clearly at the end of section 1 of the Discussion.[PET: You should provide the full name when it appeared for the first time.]Thank you for catching this. Changed to potential evapotranspiration. We also deleted PET, since it only occurs once. Competing Interests: No competing interests were disclosed. Close REPORT A CONCERN"

Prevention and interception of orthodontic problems are major concerns as they can improve the quality of life of people and save their money and time2,3. Preventing a developing malocclusion or intercepting its path is always more economic and less complicated than correcting the resulting malocclusion later4,5. In many countries, due to the shortage of specialists or the inability of the society to afford treatment, delivering orthodontic treatment after crowding has developed is not possible. However, preventive services are much cheaper and can be easily delivered by general dental practitioners6. Although interceptive treatment techniques are simple in nature, a sound diagnosis is essential. Therefore, the ability to predict future crowding in a child is vital.On the other hand, performing interceptive orthodontic procedures (such as serial extraction) at the right time is very important. The appropriate age for most interceptive interventions is when children are in the mixed dentition phase7. To predict severe crowding in a child, clinicians often use some diagnostic clues such as the premature exfoliation of primary canines, prominent bulging in the canine area and the crescent area of root resorption in roots of primary canines8. It is also proposed that the variations in teeth eruption may be an important aspect of crowding9. Although a few studies have supposed averages or standards for tooth eruption sequence9,10, little has been done to understand the relationship between tooth eruption sequence variations and dental crowding.Sampson and Richards, for instance, tested the hypothesis that pre-eruptive tooth positions might forecast crowding and proposed that a buccal eruption path of a mandibular canine indicates an insufficient space in the dental arch11. Moorrees and Reed found that the utilization of leeway space depends on the sequence of shedding and eruption of the mandibular teeth12. In another study, a low but significant correlation was found between increased crowding in the mandibular segment and the retardation of early phases of canine eruption13. More recently, Lange has claimed that those children whose teeth eruption pattern does not follow the standard sequence are at greater risk of developing crowding14. His study has been conducted on a confined population, therefore, it warrants further investigations to see whether the same results can be observed in other ethnics.Considering the shortcomings of the literature in correlating the tooth eruption sequence to the possible lack of space, this case-control study was designed to better understand whether the mandibular teeth eruption sequence differs in patients with moderate to severe dental arch crowding.","12 Jun 2014","Approved","Mahtab Nouri, School of Dentistry, Shaheed Beheshti University, Iran",NA," This is an interesting paper about the role of  sequence and percentage of eruption of first premolar in comparison to canine on development of crowding in the mandible.

One path to treatment is to develop extensive genetic networks in which human disease genes function (or dysfunction) and then target therapies to the genes identified in those networks. Eventually, an individual’s own genotype for proteins in the network may also be considered in the therapeutic options. Developing gene networks is already widely recognized as a powerful approach to identify new drug targets1–6. Gene networks are based on the principle that networks contain proteins that interact (physically and/or functionally) and that these interactions govern most, if not all, cellular functions. Importantly, gene network interactions are often conserved in different organisms even though the output of the networks may differ7. Candidate networks can be generated from studies in model organisms and then extrapolated to human cells. One can expect that, for disease gene networks, some of the interacting genes might modulate the disease phenotype thus representing potential therapeutic targets.The direct identification of disease networks from studies in human cells is, of course, challenging because of the large number of potential proteins and incomplete knowledge of how the activity of any one protein may affect the network output. Analysis of networks would benefit from studies in a tractable model organism amenable to high throughput methods. Given that network interactions may be conserved between humans and model organisms, even while the outputs may differ, we hypothesized that we can identify human disease networks in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, a simple, genetically tractable model organism, coupled to existing protein-protein interaction databases. We can then transfer that network knowledge to human cells with the goal of identifying therapeutic target genes.How valid is the approach of using fission yeast networks to identify human disease gene networks? First, the proteins that control most core cellular functions are in fact evolutionarily conserved, underscoring the “deep homology” that exists between all living organisms8,9. For example, in S. pombe >65% of the genome is orthologous to human (http://orthomcl.org/orthomcl/ and http://www.pombase.org). Second, many of the cellular processes implicated in human disease, e.g. vesicular transport, protein folding, metabolism, and RNA processing, are also evolutionarily conserved and highly interconnected10. Importantly, the value of a simple model organism for discovering “druggable” genetic pathways has recently been demonstrated for the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae11, and thus extending the study of human disease genes to fission yeast seems promising.Our approach (Figure 1) involves the expression of human disease associated genes in S. pombe and then the analysis of their effect on yeast fitness (growth). We performed high-throughput synthetic genetic array (SGA) screens to identify the fission yeast genetic modifiers that alter this effect, as measured by a simple yeast growth assay. The genetic modifiers are then assembled into human disease gene networks or clusters (using protein-protein interaction datasets from both S. pombe and humans). Any modifiers or genes in the networks or clusters represent potential therapeutic targets. This unbiased high-throughput approach could be widely and rapidly applied to many different disease-associated genes at relatively low cost.Figure 1. YANA analysis of UBA1 genes. Numbers illustrate various steps in our analysis.(1) Construction of query strains by integrating wildtype and mutant variants of the UBA1 gene into pombe. (2) Crossing the query strains (mutant or wildtype) to a complete non-essential deletion collection. (3) Bioinformatic analysis to generate the top ‘gene hits’. (4) Validation of the top hits in yeast. (5) Confirmation of the top hits in zebrafish.To demonstrate the power of YANA, we considered spinal muscular atrophy, a common neurodegenerative disease affecting approximately 1/6000 births worldwide and the number one genetic cause of infantile death in the United States12. Most cases (>90%) are caused by deletion of SMN1, a gene encoding the survival motor neuron (SMN), a protein involved in the assembly of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonuceoproteins (snRNPs)13. In contrast, X-linked spinal muscular atrophy is caused by mutations in UBA1, a gene encoding the ubiquitin activating (UBA) enzyme 1, an E1 ubiquitin ligase14,15. Consistent with a role of ubiquitination in spinal muscular atrophy and SMN biology, it was recently shown that ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis regulates SMN stability16,17. Therefore, we systematically investigated the genetic network for UBA1 to better understand the potential connections between UBA1, its modifiers and the spinal muscular atrophy phenotype. Using YANA we identified several potential therapeutic targets and validated one of these targets in a SMA vertebrate (zebrafish) model.","23 Jun 2014","Approved","Jasper Rine, Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California Berkeley, USA",NA," The Wiley et al manuscript describes a beautiful synthesis of contemporary genetic approaches to, with astonishing efficiency, identify lead compounds for therapeutic approaches to a serious human disease. I believe the importance of this paper stems from the applicability of the approach to the several thousand of rare human disease genes that Next-Gen sequencing will uncover in the next few years and the challenge we will have in figuring out the function of these genes and their resulting defects. This work presents a paradigm that can be broadly and usefully applied.  In detail, the authors begin with gene responsible for X-linked spinal muscular atrophy and express both the wild-type version of that human gene as well as a mutant form of that gene in S. pombe.  The conceptual leap here is that progress in genetics is driven by phenotype, and this approach involving a yeast with no spine or muscles to atrophy is nevertheless and N-dimensional detector of phenotype. The study is not without a small measure of luck in that expression of the wild-type UBA1 gene caused a slow growth phenotype which the mutant did not.  Hence there was something in S. pombe that could feel the impact of this protein. Given this phenotype, the authors then went to work and using the power of the synthetic genetic array approach pioneered by Boone and colleagues made a systematic set of double mutants combining the human expressed UBA1 gene with knockout alleles of a plurality of S. pombe genes.  They found well over a hundred mutations that either enhanced or suppressed the growth defect of the cells expressing UBI1.  Most of these have human orthologs.  My hunch is that many human genes expressed in yeast will have some comparably exploitable phenotype, and time will tell. Building on the interaction networks of S. pombe genes already established, augmenting these networks by the protein interaction networks from yeast and from human proteome studies involving these genes, and from the structure of the emerging networks, the authors deduced that an E3 ligase modulated UBA1 and made the leap that it therefore might also impact X-linked Spinal Muscular Atrophy. Here, the awesome power of the model organism community comes into the picture as there is a zebrafish model of spinal muscular atrophy. The principle of phenologs articulated by the Marcotte group inspire the recognition of the transitive logic of how phenotypes in one organism relate to phenotypes in another.   With this zebrafish model, they were able to confirm that an inhibitor of E3 ligases and of the Nedd8-E1 activating suppressed the motor axon anomalies, as predicted by the effect of mutations in S. pombe on the phenotypes of the UBA1 overexpression. I believe this is an important paper to teach in intro graduate courses as it illustrates beautifully how important it is to know about and embrace the many new sources of systematic genetic information and apply them broadly.

Results from human cross-sectional, twin, and prospective studies indicate that genetic factors account for 25–65% of the variation in exercise capacity3,4. Because having higher levels of exercise capacity has been shown to be beneficial for reducing the onset of cardiovascular disease, the physiological factors determining exercise capacity have been widely studied5. However, the genetic contribution to exercise capacity is not completely understood. Presently, several candidate genes contributing to improved exercise capacity have been proposed based on genome wide studies6,7, but these genes account for only a small portion of the variability in exercise capacity or training responses8.Several studies have investigated the genetic factors contributing to exercise capacity using inbred rodent models9–13. One common approach has been to screen multiple rodent strains for exercise capacity, followed by quantitative trait loci (QTL) analyses to identify loci linked to exercise capacity. This approach has been used to identify QTL for exercise capacity in rats10 and mice11,13,14. Research from our laboratory previously identified significant and suggestive QTL on several chromosomes that may house candidate genes that influence variation in exercise capacity13,14. These identified regions overlap with other mouse and human QTL, suggesting that these regions and/or genes are conserved among species13. Mouse Chromosome 14 (Chr 14), for example, contained a significant QTL for intrinsic (pre-training) exercise capacity, a significant QTL for exercise capacity after training, and a suggestive QTL for the change in exercise capacity in response to exercise training13. Several linkage markers for maximal oxygen consumption in the sedentary state in humans map to these exercise-related QTL on mouse Chr 1413,15. Therefore, the present study focused on characterizing the role of Chr 14 in regulating intrinsic exercise capacity.In the current study we employed a relatively new mouse model, chromosome substitution strains (CSS) to assess the contribution of individual chromosomes to endurance exercise capacity16,17. CSS mice are made by substituting a single chromosome from a donor inbred strain on the genetic background of a host inbred strain (recipient). Therefore phenotypic differences between the recipient or background strain mice and CSS mice support the presence of a QTL on the substituted chromosome for the phenotype being measured. Results from a previous study identified the A/J strain as having low exercise capacity in comparison to the C57BL/6J (B6) strain14. Therefore we chose to use CSS mice based on A/J and B6 inbred strains.Utilizing this CSS model, the main purposes of the present study were to investigate the effect of chromosome substitution on intrinsic exercise capacity and to identify QTL regulating intrinsic exercise capacity in mice. We hypothesized that chromosome substitution would significantly affect exercise capacity and therefore confirm the importance of Chr 14 in the genetic regulation of intrinsic exercise capacity in mice. Furthermore, we utilized linkage analysis to map QTL on Chr 14 in progeny from a cross between the CSS and host B6 strain.","23 Jun 2014","Approved","Reuben Howden, Department of Kinesiology, University of North Carolina at Charlotte, USA","Author Response 23 Apr 2014"," I appreciated and enjoyed the interesting conversation with these authors on an important and engaging topic.  I have no further comment regarding this manuscript.

Continue reading “The authors give the impression that a higher, genetically controlled, exercise capacity should equal lower disease risk based on previous work. However, I wonder if a genetic predisposition to a higher exercise capacity is more or less important that habitual exercise itself. It would be interesting to investigate disease risk in inbred mice using training programs of differing volume/intensity so the effect of environmental factors (e.g. habitual exercise) can be assessed in a controlled environment. Habitual exercise and disease risk reductions may be achievable without developing an exceptional exercise capacity. Prof. Edward Howley’s recent comments about recommending vigorous exercise, needed for high exercise capacity, from the end of his lecture may be pertinent here.” The Reviewer raises several good points in this comment. First, our goal in the Introduction was to remind the readers of the well-documented inverse relationship between cardiorespiratory fitness and morbidity and mortality in humans. This relationship appears to plateau at 10 METs, suggesting that having a fitness level above 10 METs does not confer significant additional protection (Kokkinos et al., 2008). Therefore, we agree with the Reviewer that developing high levels of exercise capacity and/or fitness are not required to achieve beneficial effects.Regarding the question of fitness versus physical activity, the Reviewer is correct in pointing out that increasing physical activity can reduce the risk of all-cause mortality and CVD and that some benefit may be gained by increasing activity without improving fitness (maximal oxygen uptake). However, Williams (2001) did point out that cardiorespiratory fitness and physical activity should be considered independently as predictors of disease risk and that the relative risk of heart disease in the most fit group is nearly half that of the most active group. These data imply that both fitness and activity are important factors in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease. Determining the genetic basis for each phenotype could yield important information regarding the beneficial effects of exercise. “Assessment of exercise capacity by treadmill running - this may be an age old question, but it remains an important one; how do the authors know they successfully assessed exercise capacity in these strains and that differences in treadmill running time were not influenced by individual strain motivation to continue exercise? While this is not a study design flaw, it could change the question asked about factors influencing sedentary behavior and chronic disease risk in human populations.” In the current study, exercise performance was assessed during a graded exercise test, which was stopped when mice exhibited pre-defined behaviors that we, and others, have defined as exhaustion. As pointed out by Booth, Laye and Spangenburg (2010), in ideal settings, exhaustion would be defined by a number of physiological markers. The large number of mice required for genetic experiments exceeded our capacity to assess maximal oxygen consumption and/or blood lactate levels at the time of testing. However, Desai et al. (1997) showed that an exercise test similar to the one utilized in the current study elicited heart rates near 750 beats per minute and a respiratory exchange ratio at or above 1.0 in mice from several inbred strains. We cannot assess an animal’s motivation to run on the treadmill so we do not know how much this might have contributed to our results. But, as demonstrated by Lerman et al. (2002) the willingness to run voluntarily is likely determined by different genetic factors than those underlying the variation in intrinsic exercise capacity in the untrained state. This latter phenotype is the focus of the current study.  “As the authors point out, a limitation of their study is the small F cohort. While the reported cohort size may be concordant with previous work, that does not mean there were sufficient meiotic events to fine map their previously identified QTL on Chr14.” The number of mice utilized in this study was sufficient to detect at least one QTL explaining 5% of the variance in exercise capacity with a power of 50% (Belknap, 2003).Increasing the number of mice would likely have allowed us to detect more QTL with smaller effects. However, as the reviewer points out, an experimental model with a greater number of recombination events, such as an advanced intercross line based on A and B6 strains, the hybrid mouse diversity panel, or mice from the collaborative cross, would probably have yielded a greater resolution for our QTL interval. “It is difficult to determine from this article if the Chr14 QTL was reduced in the current study. Perhaps the authors could provide more information about that.”  The QTL for pre-training work on Chromosome 14 identified in our previous study was located at 4 cM with a 95% CI of 0-38 cM. The suggestive QTL for time and work identified in the current study were located near 58 cM and the 95% CI were very large. Although the QTL in the current study did overlap with our previously identified QTL, it is very likely that the QTL identified in the current study are different from our previous report. A brief statement regarding this issue is located in the fourth paragraph of the Discussion section. “Did the use of CSS increase the authors confidence about specific candidate genes identified previously? What potential candidate genes are located within the present (refined?)

However, the availability of resources for genetic and genomic studies continues to increase, which should facilitate discovery of genes and gene networks that regulate variation in exercise capacity, fitness, and potentially diseases associated with low levels of fitness. “The authors give the impression that a higher, genetically controlled, exercise capacity should equal lower disease risk based on previous work. However, I wonder if a genetic predisposition to a higher exercise capacity is more or less important that habitual exercise itself. It would be interesting to investigate disease risk in inbred mice using training programs of differing volume/intensity so the effect of environmental factors (e.g. habitual exercise) can be assessed in a controlled environment. Habitual exercise and disease risk reductions may be achievable without developing an exceptional exercise capacity. Prof. Edward Howley’s recent comments about recommending vigorous exercise, needed for high exercise capacity, from the end of his lecture may be pertinent here.” The Reviewer raises several good points in this comment. First, our goal in the Introduction was to remind the readers of the well-documented inverse relationship between cardiorespiratory fitness and morbidity and mortality in humans. This relationship appears to plateau at 10 METs, suggesting that having a fitness level above 10 METs does not confer significant additional protection (Kokkinos et al., 2008). Therefore, we agree with the Reviewer that developing high levels of exercise capacity and/or fitness are not required to achieve beneficial effects.Regarding the question of fitness versus physical activity, the Reviewer is correct in pointing out that increasing physical activity can reduce the risk of all-cause mortality and CVD and that some benefit may be gained by increasing activity without improving fitness (maximal oxygen uptake). However, Williams (2001) did point out that cardiorespiratory fitness and physical activity should be considered independently as predictors of disease risk and that the relative risk of heart disease in the most fit group is nearly half that of the most active group. These data imply that both fitness and activity are important factors in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease. Determining the genetic basis for each phenotype could yield important information regarding the beneficial effects of exercise. “Assessment of exercise capacity by treadmill running - this may be an age old question, but it remains an important one; how do the authors know they successfully assessed exercise capacity in these strains and that differences in treadmill running time were not influenced by individual strain motivation to continue exercise? While this is not a study design flaw, it could change the question asked about factors influencing sedentary behavior and chronic disease risk in human populations.” In the current study, exercise performance was assessed during a graded exercise test, which was stopped when mice exhibited pre-defined behaviors that we, and others, have defined as exhaustion. As pointed out by Booth, Laye and Spangenburg (2010), in ideal settings, exhaustion would be defined by a number of physiological markers. The large number of mice required for genetic experiments exceeded our capacity to assess maximal oxygen consumption and/or blood lactate levels at the time of testing. However, Desai et al. (1997) showed that an exercise test similar to the one utilized in the current study elicited heart rates near 750 beats per minute and a respiratory exchange ratio at or above 1.0 in mice from several inbred strains. We cannot assess an animal’s motivation to run on the treadmill so we do not know how much this might have contributed to our results. But, as demonstrated by Lerman et al. (2002) the willingness to run voluntarily is likely determined by different genetic factors than those underlying the variation in intrinsic exercise capacity in the untrained state. This latter phenotype is the focus of the current study.  “As the authors point out, a limitation of their study is the small F cohort. While the reported cohort size may be concordant with previous work, that does not mean there were sufficient meiotic events to fine map their previously identified QTL on Chr14.” The number of mice utilized in this study was sufficient to detect at least one QTL explaining 5% of the variance in exercise capacity with a power of 50% (Belknap, 2003).Increasing the number of mice would likely have allowed us to detect more QTL with smaller effects. However, as the reviewer points out, an experimental model with a greater number of recombination events, such as an advanced intercross line based on A and B6 strains, the hybrid mouse diversity panel, or mice from the collaborative cross, would probably have yielded a greater resolution for our QTL interval. “It is difficult to determine from this article if the Chr14 QTL was reduced in the current study. Perhaps the authors could provide more information about that.”  The QTL for pre-training work on Chromosome 14 identified in our previous study was located at 4 cM with a 95% CI of 0-38 cM. The suggestive QTL for time and work identified in the current study were located near 58 cM and the 95% CI were very large. Although the QTL in the current study did overlap with our previously identified QTL, it is very likely that the QTL identified in the current study are different from our previous report. A brief statement regarding this issue is located in the fourth paragraph of the Discussion section. “Did the use of CSS increase the authors confidence about specific candidate genes identified previously? What potential candidate genes are located within the present (refined?) Chr14 QTL?”  Because there was no overlap between the current and previous QTL, the use of the CSS model did not increase our confidence regarding specific candidate genes in the Chromosome 14 QTL region. However, given the complexity of the exercise capacity phenotype, performing a genome scan using a complete set of CSS might be a logical step toward identifying chromosomes of interest and potential candidate genes. These chromosomes could then be targeted for more detailed analyses. “I agree that congenic strains might be useful for identifying which regions within the reported Chr14 QTL, although because of the likely complexity of factors influencing exercise capacity, demonstrating a phenotypic influence of more specific genomic regions or individual candidate genes may be challenging”  We agree with the Reviewer that identifying candidate genes for exercise and exercise-related traits is challenging. However, the availability of resources for genetic and genomic studies continues to increase, which should facilitate discovery of genes and gene networks that regulate variation in exercise capacity, fitness, and potentially diseases associated with low levels of fitness.

RNAi is mediated by small interfering RNA (siRNA), typically 21-nt in length. The siRNA, together with other cytoplasmic protein factors, forms the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The RISC recognizes the target mRNA through base pair matching, and degrades the mRNA by cleavage of the siRNA/mRNA base-matching region. As a commonly used method, a small hairpin RNA (shRNA) is experimentally expressed in cells, after which an endogenous activity (DICER) removes the loop of the hairpin to generate a functional siRNA. As a result, the expression of genes of interest can be specifically silenced1.One of the biggest technical obstacles in using RNAi techniques is that the efficacy of gene silencing varies among different siRNA molecules4–6. The difference in efficacy of siRNA molecules is mainly dependent on the first 19-nt sequence of the sense strand of siRNA. Based on systematic analyses of the common features of highly effective siRNAs, several theoretical algorithms have been developed for the design of highly effective siRNA against mRNA targets7–9. However, the designed sequences often fail to behave as predicted and, therefore, it is still necessary to evaluate the efficacy of candidate siRNAs by experimental methods. Standard methods of evaluating RNAi have been Western blotting, immunofluorescence and quantitative RT-PCR. Alternative experimental approaches using reporter assays based on luciferases or fluorescent proteins have also been developed10–12. In these reporter assays, a DNA fragment of the gene to be silenced is either inserted into the untranslated region (UTR) of a reporter gene, or connected to the reporter in frame to express a fusion protein. After co-transfection of an siRNA or shRNA expression plasmid with the reporter plasmid, the enzymatic activity of luciferases or the fluorescence intensity of fluorescent proteins is measured. Although both standard and reporter methods have been useful in evaluating RNAi efficacy, a significant limitation is that they are generally applied to populations of cells. If expression of siRNA is not uniform in the population or if only a subset of cells expresses the knockdown construct, population methods of evaluating knockdown will introduce ambiguity into the results. Such ambiguity could be removed if the effectiveness of siRNA could be evaluated in individual cells.In this article, we report the development of a quantitative, ratiometric reporter assay at the single-cell level. This assay is based on two technical advancements. The first is an improvement in the fluorescence reporter assay itself based on the use of quantitative fluorescence microscopy. Two fluorescence reporter constructs are used. One expresses the candidate shRNA together with a green fluorescent protein (EGFP); the other expresses a 19-nt target sequence inserted into a cassette expressing a red fluorescent protein (either DsRed or mCherry). Effectiveness of the candidate shRNA is evaluated depending on the extent to which it knocks down expression of the red fluorescent protein. Thus, the red-to-green fluorescence intensity ratio (appropriately normalized to controls) is used as the read-out for quantifying siRNA efficacy at the individual cell level. The image acquisition and analysis in our assay is simple and straightforward as only a standard fluorescence microscope system and image analysis software are necessary. The second advance is an improvement in the methods of preparing the required constructs, both the shRNA expression and reporter plasmids. By using a negative selection marker in the transforming plasmid, the ccdB gene, virtually all colonies of transformed bacteria contained the correct plasmid constructs. As a result, shRNA expression and red fluorescence reporter plasmids could be prepared without the need for colony selection and DNA sequence verification. We evaluated our dual fluorescence reporter assay using three test genes, vimentin, lamin A/C and Arp3, and confirmed that our fluorescent protein-based reporter assay could successfully predict siRNA efficacy with high fidelity. Taken together, these technical improvements facilitate the selection of highly effective siRNA among multiple candidates and make the ratiometric, fluorescence reporter assay practical and useful at the single-cell level.","04 Jun 2014","Approved","Kenneth Yamada, Laboratory of Cell & Developmental Biology, National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, National Institutes of Health, USA","Author Response 10 Apr 2014"," The revisions have fully resolved the specific questions that we raised.

They are both characterised by progressive cognitive decline, visual hallucinations and Parkinsonism2,3. Lewy body dementias (including DLB and PDD) are neuropathologically defined by insoluble a-synuclein aggregates in neuronal somata, forming Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites in neuronal processes2. However, it has been widely reported that Alzheimer-type pathology (most often amyloid plaques, but also to lesser extent neurofibrillary tangles) often coexists with Lewy body pathology4–6. When compared to the large-scale cortical atrophy of AD and the dopaminergic neuronal cell loss of PD, cortical cell loss in DLB and PDD is less extensive7, suggesting that alternative mechanisms may be responsible for the symptoms associated with DLB and PDD. In addition to Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, small aggregates of a-synuclein have been identified pre-synaptically in DLB and PDD, raising the possibility of a deleterious effect on synaptic function8,9. Alongside this, interactions between a-synuclein and synaptic vesicle (SV) recycling proteins have previously been described10, suggesting that SV proteins are affected by the alterations in concentration of pre-synaptic a-synuclein11. It has also been shown that dysfunctional vesicle regulation can lead to dementia-like cognitive deficits12.In AD there is substantial synaptic loss, which was revealed to provide a better indicator for cognitive impairment than the classical AD morphological changes13. Although there is emerging evidence of synaptic pathology in PD14, much less is known regarding the molecular basis and clinical consequences of the synaptic pathology associated with PD and DLB compared to AD, which may provide an opportunity for therapeutic intervention, through restoration of neurotransmitter tone.Dynamin1 is a ~ 100kDa protein with GTPase activity, that is involved in many intracellular trafficking processes including SV recycling, neurotransmitter reuptake and receptor internalization15,16. A considerable body of evidence supports a key role in synaptic transmission. For example, Dynamin1 interacts with other endocytotic proteins including amphiphysin, endophilin and syndapin through its C-terminal proline rich domain (PRD), and as a consequence, pharmacological inhibition leads to disturbance of normal SV- and endosome formation17. Furthermore, Dynamin1 knockout mice demonstrate defects in SV endocytosis during strong, but not mild, neuronal activity18. In addition, Dynamin1 may play a key role in establishing and maintaining mature neuronal structure19,20. For example, dynamin1 is upregulated during new neurite formation21 and is down-regulated during neurite retraction, and furthermore, silencing the initiation codon for dynamin significantly hampers the formation of axon-like structures.Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II-a (CaMKII) is a protein kinase highly concentrated in the brain and implicated in synaptic plasticity mechanisms22–24. Synaptic activity-triggered Ca2+ influx through NMDA receptor channels can activate CaMKII and promote its autophosphorylation at Thr286, which results in a persistently active form of the kinase25,26. The resulting CaMKII activation is likely to occur at both pre-and postsynaptic sites. At the presynaptic site, CaMKII-mediated phosphorylation of synapsin1 promotes its dissociation from synaptic vesicles, causing increased neurotransmitter release27. Activation of a calcineurin-dependent phosphatase pathway, however, can dephosphorylate CaMKII and reduce its activity28. Interestingly, Calcineurin, which is also activated by calcium, can dephosphorylate Dynamin1 and therefore regulates the SV retrieval processes16.The synaptic dysfunctions underlying the cognitive decline and psychiatric symptoms in DLB and PDD are still poorly understood. The relative lack of frank neurodegeneration in DLB and PDD combined with the potential importance of synaptic pathology, together with the key role Dynamin1 and CaMKII play in synaptic neurotransmission led us to propose the hypothesis that dysfunctional synaptic plasticity and disrupted vesicle recycling may contribute to cognitive decline. We therefore investigated the concentrations of these two key proteins in prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, and parietal cortex regions of DLB and PDD in comparison to controls and AD in relation with cognitive decline as assessed by serial measurements of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) together with semi-quantitative assessments of plaques, tangles and Lewy bodies within those regions.","23 Jan 2015","Approved","Tim Anderson, New Zealand Brain Research Institute, University of Otago, New Zealand",NA," There remains uncertainty regarding the relative contributions of alpha-synuclein, tau and amyloid pathology to the cognitive impairment in the Lewy body dementias (LBDs) - Parkinson’s disease dementia (PDD) and Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). On the justifiable preposition that whatever the underling pathology, synaptic dysfunction is a key causative mechanism of cognitive change in PDD and DLB (as it is in Alzheimer’s disease, AD), the authors in this excellent study on postmortem brain tissue examined expression levels and ratios of two synaptic proteins, Dynamin1 and CaMKII, in PDD and DLB in comparison with controls and AD, and correlated them with rate of MMSE decline. The key findings were firstly, that Dynamin1 levels in prefrontal cortex were correlated with rate of cognitive (MMSE) decline in all three dementia groups despite mean concentrations being no different from controls, and secondly, that CaMKII levels in parietal cortex were correlated with degree of plaque and tangle formation. Thus, the authors reasonably conclude that that (calcium-related) synaptic protein pathways are altered in the LBDs and likely contribute to cognitive impairment. Specific comments:The authors chose cortical regions according to known affectation in the three dementias. It might have been of interest to have included the striatum as well given that striatal amyloid changes have been reported in the LBDs. The AD group comprised greater than 2:1 females to males, whereas the control and LBD groups comprised more males than females. Is there (and was there) a gender difference in the levels of the two synaptic proteins examined? If so, could that have had any influence on the results? There is inconsistency in the concentration units of Dynamin1 in figures 1 and 4 (µgm/g protein and ng/g protein respectively). Figure 4 depicts the significant relationship between Dynamin1 levels and MMSE progression. Three patients had a decline of around 15 MMSE points per year, a remarkably rapid progression and considerably greater than the remainder of the dementia patients. Is there something different about these patients and does the significant relationship still hold if these three are omitted from the analysis?The association of Dynamin1 levels with rate of cognitive decline in the face of normal Dynamin1 levels seems surprising and a clearer explanation of this apparent ambiguity would be welcome.

Much attention has focussed on optimising its effectiveness at diagnosing pre-malignant lesions. Polyp detection rate (PDR) or adenoma detection rate (ADR) can be used as markers for colonoscopy quality. The implication is that careful and optimal mucosal visualisation enhances polyp detection and is a reliable marker of a colonoscopist performing appropriately and effectively1,2. Recent data have demonstrated the importance of adenoma detection rate as not only a metric of colonosocopy performance but as an independent predictor of protection against subsequent colorectal cancer3. PDR is defined as the detection of one or more polyps at colonoscopy. Several factors may influence PDR, obviously including patient selection and case mix, but recently it has been suggested that the time the procedure is performed and the order of colonoscopy within a session also influence colonoscopy performance.Inconsistent results examining the PDR of colonoscopies throughout the workday have been reported. A number of studies have reported that PDRs decrease as the day4,5 or endoscopy list6 progress, and that PDRs in morning lists are higher than afternoon lists7. However this effect does not appear to be universal across endoscopy units with other studies reporting no such reduction in polyp detection overall8 or when colonoscopies are performed in half day blocks9 or 3-hour shifts10.This effect, where shown, has been generally attributed to endoscopist fatigue4,11 although this was not independently assessed in those studies. This effect appears logical and correlates with increasing errors in other repetitive or tiring vocations such as errors by house officers related to time in hospital12, inadvertent errors at simulated laparoscopy as mental and physical workload increases13 and impairment in perceptual and motor ability in nurses toward the end of nightshifts14. Queue position has been suggested as a novel surrogate measure for operator fatigue6. There has also been a suggestion that endoscopists may rush procedures later in the list15. Another possible hypothesis is that bowel preparation may be a factor, the inference being that bowel preparation is often prescribed appropriately for morning endoscopies but the regimen is not appropriately altered for optimum bowel preparation in the afternoon.This apparent effect of reduced PDR throughout the work day has been superimposed on top of the difference in performance between endoscopists, which has been reported on multiple occasions; even within a group of fully competent endoscopists there appears to be spectrum of polyp detection rates3,16,17. This endoscopist effect has not been consistently accounted for in the published data examining the effect of timing on PDR7.The optimisation of colonoscopy will impact upon its safety and cost-effectiveness. Increasing numbers of endoscopies are being performed both in the UK18 and USA19, partly as a result of successful screening programmes18. This has led to higher patient flow though endoscopy units. To accommodate this increase in demand, units have had to expand their provision of colonoscopies by number of endoscopy rooms, length of lists or extra lists.To accommodate this extra-workload, our unit has run regular evening lists (6–9pm) for over two years to meet this increasing demand and improve patient convenience and we are aware of other endoscopy units developing similar strategies. However it is not known whether evening colonoscopy is as effective as traditional day-time colonoscopy. As evening colonoscopy makes up a significant and increasing amount of our overall workload, it is important to establish that the service in terms of performance metrics is appropriate. It is also unknown whether colonoscopy performance declines in the evening; this specific effect, as opposed to morning or afternoon colonoscopy has not been examined in the previous studies. This study aims to review polyp detection rates in our routine clinical practice, with particular reference to this evening session. We aimed to test the hypothesis that polyp detection would be reduced in the evening sessions. The majority of evening colonoscopists will have already worked a full working day. Although not specifically assessed, they may be assumed to be more fatigued than those working in the morning or afternoon lists. We also aim to review PDRs in relation to other factors in routine clinical practice.","17 Jul 2014","Approved","Christopher Wells, University Hospital of North Tees, UK","Author Response (F1000Research Advisory Board Member) 07 Aug 2014"," The authors describe the practice of performing colonoscopy during an evening session. With increasing demand on endoscopic services in the UK the move towards 7 day & 3 lists per day working will become more commonplace. Given the concerns about deterioration in performance it is important to know that the quality of the procedure is not affected by when the procedure is performed. The authors describe the polyp detection rate, a marker of quality of colonoscopy, in a retrospective dataset gathered from their hospital records. The data are used to construct a model which predicts changes in PDR. The data suggests that the quality of colonoscopy is maintained in evening sessions. This provides evidence supporting this evolving change of practice that will provide units with the assurances that this change in work pattern is a viable option. The paper is therefore useful and timely.One possible confounder that the authors do not describe is the number of colonoscopists that perform evening endoscopies - if it is just a few enthusiasts then they may be more vigilant, compared with the daytime regular endoscopists. It would be useful to know that the proportion of procedures performed by each endoscopist was the same throughout the 3 sessions as any differences may be due to the technical skills of these endoscopists.    I have read this submission.

The remaining hydroxyls of the alditol moiety are ubiquitously modified by D-alanyl esterification or glycosylation1–3. A dlt operon, which typically codes for DltA, DltB, DltC and DltD proteins, is required for the D-alanylation of lipoteichoic acids4. D-alanylation brings in positively charged amino-groups and partially neutralizes the net negative charges of the phosphate groups on the lipoteichoic acid backbone. The reduction of D-alanyl content on the cell surface has been found to be associated with increased autolysis3,5 and susceptibility to host defense peptides and other antibiotics6,7. Impaired D-alanylation of lipoteichoic acid also reduces the ability of bacteria to colonize any surface8 and form antibiotics-resistant biofilms9. Therefore, the dlt-encoded proteins required for the lipoteichoic acid D-alanylation pathway could serve as novel targets for fighting emerging infectious diseases caused by Gram-positive pathogens10. The DltA inhibitor 5’-O-[N-(D-alanyl)-sulfamoyl]adenosine for example, designed by analogy to D-alanyl adenylate (D-Ala-AMP), has been shown to significantly suppress the growth of B. subtilis when used in combination with vancomycin11.The D-alanyl carrier protein ligase DltA (formed by ~500 amino acid residues)4 closely resembles (~30% sequence identity) the adenylation domains (also called adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-forming domains) found in bacterial non-ribosomal peptide synthetases12. Its remote homologs include the acyl- and aryl-(coenzyme A) CoA synthetases and firefly luciferases13. As shown in Figure 1, DltA catalyzes the ATP-driven adenylation of D-alanine and the subsequent transfer of the activated D-alanyl group to the thiol group of 4’-phosphopantetheine, which is covalently bound to a serine side chain of D-alanyl carrier protein DltC (~80 amino acid residues)4. As previously shown for such one-protein-two-enzymes homologs14,15, crystal structures of two DltA proteins have also been observed in adenylation and thiolation conformations, respectively16,17 (Figure 1). The thiolation conformation of B. subtilis DltA (BsDltA)18 resembles previously determined structures of a bacterial acetate-CoA synthetase (ACS) and 4-chlorobenzoate-CoA ligase crystallized in their respective thiolation state15,19. On the other hand, the adenylation conformation of B. cereus DltA (BcDltA)17 resembles those observed in the crystal structures of the firefly luciferase PheA (phenylalanine-activating domain of the first module of the Bacillus brevis gramicidin S synthetase I), DhbE (2,3-dihydroxybenzoate activation domain from B. subtilis), a yeast acetyl-CoA synthetase and 4-chlorobenzoate-CoA ligase13,14,20–22. The two conformations captured in the crystal structures of the two closely related DltA proteins (56% sequence identity) are related by a ~146º rotation around a hinge residue Asp-399 in BcDltA (Asp-398 in BsDltA), which is a invariable residue equivalent to Asp-517 in Salmonella typhimurium acetyl-CoA synthetase23. The region surrounding this hinge residue (residues Arg-397 to Glu-413 of BcDltA green in Figure 1B) contains an important triphosphate-interacting residue Arg-39724 and a ß-hairpin which serves as part of the pantetheine channel as observed in the bacterial acetyl-CoA synthetase23.Figure 1. Structure and function of DltA. A. A two-step reaction catalyzed by DltA. B. The adenylation and thiolation conformations of DltA. In the first adenylation reaction, D-alanine is converted into DltA-bound D-alanine adenylate (D-Ala-AMP). This reaction is catalyzed by the adenylation conformation of DltA shown as DltA/AMP complex. In the subsequent thiolation reaction, the activated alanyl group in the intermediate is transferred to the thiol group of DltC-linked 4’-phosphopantetheine (DltC-SH). The second reaction is catalyzed by the thiolation conformation of DltA shown also as DltA/AMP complex. Most part of the major N-terminal domain of DltA (residues 2 - 399) is shown in gray. The majority of the minor C-terminal domain of DltA (residues 400–504) is shown in salmon. Residues between Arg-397 and Glu-413 are highlighted in green.We previously studied the adenylation reaction of BcDltA in the absence of any D-alanyl carrier to enable the thiolation reaction17. The resulting specificity constants (kcat/KM) for D- and L-alanine differed by merely ~3-fold, which could not explain the fact that teichoic acid is overwhelmingly modified by D- but not L-alanine25. As suggested by a study on a spectrum of DltA homologs which have residual aminoacyl-CoA synthetase activity42, CoA has been confirmed to be a substitute for the D-alanyl carrier protein DltC as the thiolation substrate of BcDltA24. Here we report further biochemical analysis of BcDltA. Noticeable differences were observed in Michaelis constants KM and turnover rates kcat. The presence of CoA, hence the enabled adenylation and thiolation cycle, enhanced the enzyme’s apparent affinities to its cognitive substrate ATP and D-alanine by approximately an order of magnitude. Since BcDltA is a slow enzyme with turnover rate less than 1 s-1, much slower than bacterial Acyl-CoA synthetases (~102 s-1)23 and 4-chlorobenzoate-CoA ligase (~10 s-1)26, the observed Michaelis constants should closely approximate the corresponding dissociation constants, and therefore provide some insight into the stability of short-lived enzyme-substrate complexes. We also determined the structure of BcDltA in the absence of any substrate. This structure is noticeably more disordered than previously reported DltA structures16,17,24, which may explain the enzyme’s lower affinity to ATP in the absence of the other two substrates. Interestingly, CoA-enhanced affinities to ATP and D-alanine imply that the thiolation substrate CoA-bound BcDltA has higher affinity to both adenylation substrates as compared to CoA-free BcDltA.","17 Jun 2014","Approved","Charles Bell, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Ohio State University, USA","Author Response (Member of the F1000 Faculty) 23 Jun 2014"," ltA catalyzes two reactions: (1) an adenylation reaction in which ATP is joined to D-Ala to form D-Ala-AMP (PPi is released), and (2) a thiolation reaction in which D-Ala is transferred from D-Ala-AMP to a phosphopantetheine group of D-alanyl carrier protein (DltC). The reaction can be mimicked in vitro by substituting CoA for DltC (does this also happen in vivo?). Previous crystal structures have indicated that the two reactions are promoted by two distinct conformational states of the enzyme, which differ by a large rearrangement of a C-terminal domain that closes over the active site. In this work, Du & Luo provide kinetic data to suggest that binding of the two substrates for the adenylation reaction (ATP and D-Ala) is promoted by the presence of the substrate (CoA) for the second reaction. The selectivity for binding of D-Ala as opposed to L-Ala is also enhanced significantly by the presence of CoA. A new scheme for the reaction cycle is proposed in which instead of forming an empty enzyme when the final product D-Ala-CoA is released, free CoA is rapidly “exchanged” in for D-Ala-CoA to keep the enzyme in its thiolation conformation. Then new D-Ala and ATP substrates bind (with the enzyme still in its CoA-bound thiolation conformation), and CoA is released to allow the enzyme to adopt the adenylation conformation, which is required for ATP and D-Ala to react. Binding of CoA to the newly formed D-Ala-AMP complex then puts the enzyme back in the thiolation conformation. The new reaction scheme is considerably more complicated than one would expect, but seems to account for the observed kinetic data. The authors propose that the biological purpose for this type of mechanism is to limit binding (and reaction) of ATP and D-Ala to conditions in which the 2nd substrate (presumably DltC in vivo) is available, so as to avoid non-productive formation and release D-Ala-AMP. A crystal structure of the apo form of DltA is also determined, which shows that in the absence of substrates the enzyme adopts the adenylation conformation, and that several loops on the enzyme are considerably more disordered than in previous structures of various substrate or product-bound states. The new structure does not add a lot, but is meant to support the concept that ATP and D-Ala do not bind tightly to the enzyme unless CoA is around to reduce the overall flexibility. The manuscript is reasonably well written, scientifically sound, and should be of fairly broad interest, particularly for those studying other types of two-reaction enzymes, such as in non-ribosomal peptide synthesis, and possibly even enzymes like amino-acyl tRNA synthetases. I found the manuscript to be rather uninteresting, until I got to the end of the discussion, where the newly proposed reaction scheme of Figure 6 is presented, and a biological purpose of the observed phenomena is proposed. If there is some way to bring these aspects into the Abstract or the Introduction, a potential reader might be drawn in a little bit earlier than I was. The proposed scheme is quite unusual in that CoA supposedly promotes binding of ATP and D-Ala, but subsequent release of CoA is required for the two to react. Presumably this means that the rate of the catalytic step for the adenylation reaction must be considerably faster than the rates of ATP and D-Ala dissociation, or else the enzyme could return to the apo state, and presumably the adenylation conformation, when CoA is released. Are these parameters known? Also, is the physiological concentration of DltC acceptor protein, which presumably takes over the role of CoA in vivo, high enough to be consistent with the proposed reaction cycle? It would need to rebind to the enzyme in the exchange step before the enzyme reverts to the adenylation conformation. Presumably the rate of DltC binding is faster than the rate of reversion back to the adenylation conformation? The authors should discuss/clarify these points. Minor points: The data in this paper demonstrate the effect on the enzyme by CoA, a mimic of the in vivo substrate DltC, but not for DltC itself. Is there some reason why this is difficult to demonstrate with DltC experimentally? Was it previously known from other structures that the apo form of the enzyme is in the adenylation conformation, or is this a new insight? In general the authors could do a little bit of a better job describing the previous structures in the Introduction. Why were the previous structures of the B. subtilis enzyme found to be in the thiolation conformation despite the absence of CoA (or DltC)? Is there no structure available with CoA?  References 16 and 18 are the same. I have read this submission.

Myocardial hypertrophy in otherwise healthy, non-hypertensive individuals can be caused by exercise-induced arterial hypertension (EIAH)4–6 and may also result in poor prognosis7. Moreover, exercise-induced hypertrophy may cause sudden cardiac death in athletes8. However, myocardial hypertrophy induced by extensive exercise presents so called “normal diastolic” function, which might be a result of “physiological” adaptation9,10. EIAH or elevated blood pressure values during exercise might have a “negative” impact on cardiac function in athletes and might be one of the important factors causing “exercise-induced” cardiac fatigue (Figure 1). Our hypothesis is provocative, but this suggestion might become important for many professional and leisure athletes (Figure 2).Figure 1. Factors which affect cardiac structures and function during exercise.This figure shows the factors with possible negative influence on myocardium like inflammation, fibrosis etc. It demonstrates the possible complexity of different actions.Figure 2. Scheme of possible adaptation of cardiac cavities in endurance sport and possible pathological enlargement/hypertrophy in case of exercise-induced arterial hypertension.Right and left atrium have more connective tissue construct as muscular ventricular chambers and more affinity for pathological enlargement in case of pressure overload.Physical activity in the general population is of fundamental importance11,12. The role of EIAH in normotensive adult athletes13 or healthy men is currently under discussion6,14. It is unclear how far endurance sport can influence a “negative remodelling” of the athlete’s heart15. The dosage of exercise bouts which causes cardiac injury18,19, and the “true pathologic values” of EIAH are unknown or under debate6.Endurance sport is linked to cardiac injury20. In individual cases, long term training might lead to arrhythmias21, atrial fibrillation22,23 or myocardial fibrosis16,24 and early sudden cardiac death24–26, female athletes are less commonly affected26,27.The type of sport discipline has also an influence on the type of hypertrophy. Some authors distinguish the strength-trained heart and an endurance-trained heart10,28. Further factors that might influence exercise-induced hypertrophy are genetic factors29,30, gender31, environmental factors32, endocrine factors33 and arterial hypertension34.In this study, we examined the impact of EIAH on cardiac hypertrophy in 51 normotensive (at rest) healthy Ironman athletes with long daily training times.","01 Jul 2014","Approved","Marta Sitges, Thorax Institute, Universitat de Barcelona and Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Spain",NA," The study examined the potential relationship between exercise-induced arterial hypertension (EIAH) and left ventricular hypertrophy in 51 normotensive healthy male triathletes. For that purpose, they divided the study population into two groups according to left ventricular mass (LVM), choosing as cut-off point of significance left ventricular hypertrophy: 220g and analyzed the systolic blood pressure (BPs) in a cardiopulmonary exercise test on a cycle-ergometer. Triathletes with LVM> 220g showed significantly higher BPs at the anaerobic threshold and a trend to higher BPs values at the aerobic threshold and at maximum exercise level. They concluded that significant left ventricular hypertrophy is associated with higher blood pressure at the anaerobic and aerobic threshold and suggest that endurance athletes with EIAH could benefit from preventive antihypertensive treatment.  Comments:The assessment of blood pressure response to exercise has been typically limited to systolic values. Classic studies such as the Framingham study and preliminary studies from our group 1 2 have identified the diastolic pressure response to exercise as the best predictor of late development of hypertension. It would have been interesting to perform a complete analysis of the blood pressure response during exercise, including both systolic and diastolic values. The authors relate EIAH to the development of atrial fibrillation and in fact, this association is used in the title. The study analysis though, did not demonstrate this association, as clinical or electric data related to atrial fibrillation are not analyzed. Athletes with LV mass >220g showed a significantly higher left atrial diameter and a tendency to a higher left atrial volume but all values <U+200B><U+200B>are within normal limits. Moreover, the author connects EIAH with aorta stiffness but no differences between groups were documented in LVOT and all values are also within normal limits. The authors claim that they did not find any particular right ventricular remodeling, but the only reported data concerning RV analysis are insufficient: fractional RV area and RV diameter measurement in the parasternal view. On the other hand, this later measurement was significantly larger in the group with LV> 220g. We would like to point out two potential typographic errors in Table 1: the data on weight and height seem to be exchanged and the data concerning the systolic diameter of the left ventricle seems indeed to be related to diastolic diameter. How was the cut-off point of LV mass 220g selected? Why didn’t the authors choose an indexed value of LV mass by body size? At least, this should be acknowledged as a limitation of the study.  It is well known that measuring blood pressure at high loads of physical exercise might be challenging. The methodology of the determination of blood pressure during exercise should be better described. Overall a state of the art and an interesting line of investigation, with illustrative results but it may be still preliminary to claim an association with atrial fibrillation and advise preventive antihypertensive treatment in athletes.   References1.

Dysfunction is thought to occur when inappropriate excitation-inhibition balances occur1. From a modeling perspective, these balances are determined by the choice of parameters in the equations representing neurons and networks. Mathematical models of neurons and networks are developed so that they can be used to determine the mechanisms underlying brain functions. However, it is difficult to assess whether the mechanisms determined from mathematical models actually occur biologically2,3. Furthermore, it is well known that cellular models used in building network models affect and can dictate the network output4,5. To address this recognized difficulty we are developing models that are based on well-defined experimental contexts in which both the cellular and the network aspects of the model can be considered simultaneously6,7. Using such models, we aim to help determine, predict and test biologically based mechanisms.Here we use a well-defined experimental context of an in vitro intact, whole hippocampus preparation in which spontaneous population theta and theta-gamma rhythms are expressed8,9. Access to many cellular details is possible in vitro, and with a physiologically relevant output of theta and theta-gamma rhythms, a reasonable and functional scenario is also present. We have previously developed models of CA1 fast-spiking inhibitory cells in the same experimental context, and used them to show that model inhibitory networks of these fast-spiking cells exhibit sharp transitions between random and coherent firings at high frequencies (>90 Hz) when connectivity constraints were imposed6. In this article, we present the result of CA1 pyramidal cell models developed in the same context of this in vitro whole hippocampus preparation. Similar to our previous cellular model developments6, the models presented here are biologically-based at the cellular level, but do not have a biophysical representation in terms of conductance-based model representations. These CA1 models use a simple two variable mathematical formulation based on Izhikevich10 and they include rebound firing and adaptation characteristics. Using these simple, yet biologically-based models, we can build and examine several large network models that are aligned with the biology. Subsequent analyses of these large network models could determine the mechanisms by which particular cellular characteristics critically contribute to the population activities observed in our experimental context.","24 Jun 2014","Approved","Alla Borisyuk, Department of Mathematics, University of Utah, USA","Author Response 24 Jun 2014"," The article presents minimal models for CA1 pyramidal cells, based on fitting the frequency-current curves that had been experimentally recorded in whole hippocampus preparation.There are two types of models, differing in some parameter values, to account for “strongly” and “weakly” adapting cell varieties. The goal of the present work is to present the models and their basic fit to single cell data, in preparation for future large network studies.Comments:I think this work would be much stronger if testable predictions were generated from the models. For example, what would be the responses to time varying inputs and how the responses would differ between  the strongly and weakly adapting cells? It is not clear to me that obtaining one model for each of variety of cells is sufficient. For example, two strongly adapting cells have very different rheobase current values. If you fit the model to each cell individually, I expect that you will end up with two very different parameter sets. What would be the consequences for responses to time varying inputs, for example? Considerations like these will be very important when you decide how much variability and in which parameters to include in the  network model. This is also related to the fact that a single model was not able to capture all desired properties of the weakly adapting model.

The creation of these induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells and their replication in human somatic cells has been heralded as a major breakthrough in regenerative medicine (Takahashi et al., 2007). However, the method for generating iPS cells involves complex genetic manipulation and it is beset by low efficiency of conversion and yield (Liao et al., 2008). Currently, great strides are being made to improve the efficiency of iPS cell production by incorporating small molecules, vitamin C, valporic acid, microRNAs and different combinations of transcriptional factors into the protocols (reviewed by Huo & Zambidis, 2013; Jung et al., 2014). Two recent sets of groundbreaking studies reported in Nature appear to overcome most of these problems (Obokata et al., 2014a; Obokata et al., 2014b). The authors reported that simply bathing somatic cells in a mild acid could reprogram them to become pluripotent stem cells. They harvested spleen cells from 1-week-old Oct-4-GFP transgenic mice, and isolated the CD45+ population by flow cytometry. The CD45+ splenocytes were then treated with acidified HBSS (pH 5.7) for 25 min at 37°C and maintained in DMEM/F-12 culture medium containing B27 and Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) for one to seven days. This simple procedure activated the Oct4 promoter two days post-treatment, making the splenocytes express the GFP reporter.The authors named the cells generated by this procedure “Stimulus-triggered acquisition of pluripotency (STAP) stem cells” (Obokata et al., 2014a). STAP cells were demonstrated to be able to form all organs and tissues in chimeric embryos, when injected into host blastocysts (Obokata et al., 2014b). Furthermore, the authors reported that STAP cells could also contribute to the placenta, something that iPS and ES cells are normally incapable of doing (Rossant, 2008). In other words, STAP cells appear to be totipotent rather than pluripotent. If these surprising findings could be confirmed, it would revolutionize regenerative medicine by providing a simple, cheap, and immunocompatible source of stem cells for tissue/organ repair.There are several fundamental questions that need to be addressed before STAP stem cells can be accepted as one of the main methods for generating stem-like iPS cells, such as: Can these findings be replicated by other researchers? And, other than mouse spleen cells, can this STAP protocol be applied to other somatic cells? Since the publication of the STAP articles, there has been a recent groundswell of comments on social media platforms, including blogs (Knoeffler Lab Stem Cell Blog), networking sites (ResearchGate) and Twitter, that have cast considerable doubt on Obokata et al.’s findings. In this context, we have attempted to create STAP cells using their most updated protocol (Obokata et al., 2014c).","21 May 2014","Approved","Janet Rossant, Developmental and Stem Cell Biology, Hospital for Sick Children, Canada","Author Response 24 May 2014"," Tang et al. report attempts to replicate the findings of Obokata et al. on the derivation of pluripotent STAP cells by acid treatment of mouse splenocytes. Despite attempting to replicate the exact details of the Obokata experiments as published, they were not able to observe any activation of an Oct4-GFP transgene or of the endogenous pluripotent markers after several days of culture of the treated cells. While these results do suggest that the STAP protocol is not simple and easily replicated, negative findings are always hard to interpret and need to be very carefully controlled. For this reason there are some points that need to be considered: It is not clear how much cell death occurred after the acid treatment - was this at the same level as reported by Obokata et al.? What was the sensitivity of the PCR analysis of the expression of the pluripotent genes? A control analysis of different levels of expression in existing pluripotent lines would help. Is it possible to repeat the analysis with a different Oct4-reporter to avoid the potential confusion with green autofluorescence?There is merit in this replication study being published in the scientific literature, however when trying to reproduce a null finding the controls used need to be well defined to prevent any ambiguity.  I have read this submission.

Typically a sufficiently rare deviant stimulus evokes a long-duration negative potential shift beginning 100–200 ms after the stimulus onset, referred to as mismatch negativity (MMN). MMN has been considered an electrophysiological correlate of a mismatch between the incoming stimulus and a sensory memory trace2.The underlying neuronal mechanisms of MMN have been extensively studied and electrical and magnetic recordings in human subjects have localized the MMN generator to the auditory cortex3, although a frontal component has also been observed4 (see also review5). In addition, a substantial amount of animal work has contributed to our mechanistic understanding of MMN. MMN-like responses have been reported in various animal species including cats6, guinea pigs7, rabbits8, monkeys9 and rats10,11. Interestingly, animal studies have suggested that at least in some species subcortical brain regions, thalamus12 and hippocampus11–13 might be involved in generating subcomponents of MMN. It is worth noting that hippocampus has been suggested to play a major role of detecting novelty14,15. In support of this, posterior hippocampal lesion dramatically reduces the novelty related cortical P3a event-related potential and autonomic skin reaction16. However, it is still unclear whether MMN and P3a represent different functional outcome or whether they represent the short-term and medium-term trace of the same novelty/deviant detection mechanism15. In addition, severity of Alzheimer’s disease, and presumable the progression of hippocampal damage, is related to the MMN amplitude decrease17. Nevertheless, the involvement of hippocampus in MMN is not supported by the intracranial EEG recording studies of neurological patients18,19 although the plausible confounding effect of the neurological disorder of subjects or medication to MMN cannot be ruled out.The contribution of hippocampus to MMN has been studied in more detail in rats but only in anesthetized animals11 (and Ruusuvirta et al., submitted). Therefore, the role of anesthesia to MMN needs to be clarified. A chronic recording in non-anaesthetized animals also opens possibilities for studying the effects of neuropharmacological manipulation without confounding effects of anesthesia. In this regard, an interesting target is the basal forebrain cholinergic projection system to the hippocampus and cortex, which degenerates early on in Alzheimer's disease20. Only few studies so far have investigated the effects of cholinergic drugs on MMN. Scopolamine, a centrally acting cholinergic antagonist, reduced MMN amplitude to frequency change one hour after injection in young adults21, while no such change was observed in elderly subjects22. However, both studies reported some modulation effects of scopolamine on P50 and P100 components.The main aim of this study was to develop a non-anesthetized rat model of cortical MMN. In addition, we wanted to clarify the putative role of the hippocampus in generation of MMN or its subcomponents in non-anesthetized rats. Second, this model allowed us to distinguish between MMN and long-term adaptation to standard auditory stimuli. Therefore, we repeated the oddball stimulus set on two daily sessions and on consecutive days to assess within-day and more long-term adaptation of the response. Finally, we wanted to elucidate the contribution of the cholinergic projection system in cortical and hippocampal MMN by the central muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine. We report evidence for repetition-induced attenuation of the mid-latency auditory ERPs in freely-moving rats but no correspondence to the sustained negativity around 100–200 ms in response to the deviant sound that is referred to as MMN in humans.","30 Jun 2014","Approved with Reservations","Timm Rosburg, Experimental Neuropsychology Unit, Department of Psychology, Saarland University, Germany","Author Response 13 Aug 2014"," Gurevicius and colleagues provided a revised version of their study, but I consider the improvements as marginal and, unfortunately, many issues I raised in my previous review have not been addressed. Furthermore, an inspection of the submitted data file revealed some inconsistencies with the reported statistics.Gurevicius and colleagues make two claims: (1), there is no evidence for an MMN in the hippocampus of the rat. (2), there is a ‘long-term habituation’ effect of the cortical P60 component. However, there is a considerable lack of transparency in the data presentation; on the basis of the provided information, the reader cannot fully evaluate the reported results.Figure 2 has now been re-labelled, as showing grand average data from Day 1. At the same time, the graphs are still labelled as ‘representative examples’. This is not as clear as it should be. First, it is not clear what is meant by ‘representative’. Second, grand average data should not be called ‘examples’. Moreover, in Figure 2 the absolute amplitudes of the cortical P60 are larger than the absolute amplitudes of the cortical N40. This is somewhat in contrast to Figure 3 that shows similar absolute amplitudes for the two components. Finally, given the significant difference in the hippocampal P60 between standards and deviants, grand average data of Experiment 2 need to be depicted, as previously requested. The authors do not describe how artefacts were identified and on what basis data were excluded. It is insufficient to state that data were excluded due to a “poor signal (i.e. bad electrode contact)”. Such a description hinders any replication of the study. It is still not fully clear what reference electrode was used. The authors state a “common reference electrode” was used but they do not describe which electrodes were used for calculating it. As also previously criticized by other reviewers, the description of the conducted statistics is incomplete with some F values missing, but there are some inconsistencies as well.(a), Table 1 implies that one data point each was excluded from the analysis of Experiment 1. However, the submitted data file does not contain missing values. Consequently, the data file is hardly suited to reproduce the study results.(b), it is also worth noting that the algebraic signs are reversed in this data file (with positive values for the N40 and negative for the P60 and P110 amplitude values).(c), furthermore, attempts to reproduce the study results are hampered by the fact that sometimes the degrees of freedom are incorrectly reported (in particular for the repetition effects). Moreover, for the repetition effects, it is unclear whether the reported results of the ANOVA were Greenhouse-Geisser corrected when necessary. This needs to be indicated. - When I re-calculated the repetition effect of the cortical P60 in an ANOVA with Day (Day 1 vs. Day 2 vs. Day 3) and ODDBALL (standards vs. deviants) as within-subjects factors with the provided data, I revealed an insignificant main effect of DAY [F (2, 16) = 3.451, p = 0.094 after Greenhouse-Geisser correction, epsilon = 0.556]. As previously mentioned, the concepts of ‘long-term habituation’, ‘short-term habituation’ and ‘long-term adaptation’ are poorly described and no explicit operational definitions are provided. On the basis of previous 'long-term habituation' studies in humans, I would not expect to see response decrements from day to day but within each experimental day (i.e. within an experimental session); on the basis of the provided data, I am little convinced that there were actually any substantial response decrements from day to day in Experiment 1 (see comment point 4 c). The authors argue that the contrast between the present and previous studies “can be ascribed to the confounding effect of anesthesia on neuronal functions, as evidenced in a human anesthesia study”. This is not particularly convincing since the cited study of Heinke et al. (2004) showed that the human MMN is diminished by anesthesia rather than the other way around. Moreover, the authors claim in the Introduction that the ""severity of Alzheimer’s disease, and presumable the progression of hippocampal damage, is related to the MMN amplitude decrement"", referring to the study of Pekkonen et al. (1994). However, the severity of Alzheimer’s disease and the progression of hippocampal damage were not related to the MMN amplitude decrement in this study. The authors need to clarify to what data the correlation matrix in Table 2 refers to, as previously noted. The title of the study needs to be re-considered, as previously outlined. I have read this submission. I believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard, however I have significant reservations, as outlined above.

We chose these data because it is the first day of the exposure to auditory stimuli, and as such represents the shape of the waveform of other recordings, too.  Figure 2 represents the group average for the raw data while Fig. 3 shows the average of maximum peak amplitudes within these time windows. Since the components had some latency variation (see Table 1), the two ways of averaging the responses do not necessary lead to the same result.  Because of the huge amount of raw data and the format of the journal, we are, unfortunately, not able to provide all the complimentary figures of all our significant findings.However, as we strongly support transparency of scientific data and discussion, we would be pleased to provide additional figures for any interested reader. 2.

As also previously criticized by other reviewers, the description of the conducted statistics is incomplete with some F values missing, but there are some inconsistencies as well. We will add the missing F values whenever there is a significant p-value.  (a), Table 1 implies that one data point each was excluded from the analysis of Experiment 1. However, the submitted data file does not contain missing values.

If data violate the sphericity assumption there are several corrections that can be applied to produce a valid F-ratio (Greenhouse–Geisser correction is one of them). Other option is to use multivariate test, because it is not dependent upon the assumption of sphericity and SPSS will automatically produce test statistics. In case of cortical P60 during Experiment 1, we could find, for example, Pillai’s trace Value=0.066, F(2,6)=5,87; P=0.039 [IBM SPSS Statistics Version 21].

However, the severity of Alzheimer’s disease and the progression of hippocampal damage were not related to the MMN amplitude decrement in this study.We have rephrased this sentence (“can be ascribed to the confounding effect of anesthesia on consciousness level”) to the following for clarity. In rodents, high doses of the standard anesthesia, urethane, severely reduces MMN amplitude (our unpublished finding). Notably, a light anesthesia in rats enables to elicit MMN which is not seen in awake state. Therefore, it seems that rats need to be lightly sedated to a produce state similar to human pre-attentive state.Previous version of the sentence “Severity of Alzheimer’s disease, and presumable the progression of hippocampal damage, is related to the MMN amplitude decrement"", will be replaced in the resubmission “As it has been noted, that Alzheimer’s disease affects MMN.

The authors need to clarify to what data the correlation matrix in Table 2 refers to, as previously noted.As described in the text, Table 2 summarizes mutual correlations between amplitudes of middle-latency components.

The grant was assigned to MM for the contribution of ULB to the research project. GG received a salary from the grant. The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.","IntroductionTremor is the most common movement disorder encountered during daily practice1. It causes functional disability and social inconvenience, disturbing daily life activities. Its incidence and prevalence increase with ageing1. The response of tremor to pharmacotherapy is variable and a combination of drugs is often required after a few years of therapy. Neurosurgical procedures are considered when the clinical response is not sufficient or when the patient becomes refractory. However, a number of patients do not respond to current therapies. Therefore novel strategies are being developed. New bioengineering therapies are now emerging as viable solutions2. In particular, recent studies aim to develop and validate a new treatment for upper limb tremor based on the combination of functional electrical stimulation (FES) with a brain-computer interface (BCI)2–3. The main goal is to set up a semi-automatic procedure to reduce/stop upper limb tremor, with a selective cancellation of tremor oscillations while preserving natural voluntary movement. The intentionality of movement is tracked by the BCI, in order to trigger FES in the upper limbs. Such concepts open new doors for the treatment of numerous neurological disorders affecting the upper limbs.We describe a multimodal detection of the intentionality of movement by fusing signals from EEG, EMG and kinematic sensors (in particular gyroscopes and accelerometers). A kinematic module is applied purely for analyzing tremor, but also finds a specific application for the early detection of movement in patients presenting with a rest tremor - a tremor occurring while in a rest position. Indeed, it has been reported that patients presenting a rest tremor show a decrement of the rest tremor before voluntary movement onset4. This phenomenon might be induced by a cortico-cerebellar activation during voluntary movements5. Why the use of a multimodal detection of the intentionality of movement? Although the potential for BCIs in neurological disorders is huge, the applicability of current BCI systems has been limited by several factors6. One of them is the poor performance of BCIs based on EEG analysis only (also due to: inter-individual differences in the detectability of movement-related EEG-activity; differences in the way BCI users can voluntary modify their brain activity; and the fact that brain atrophy and neuroplastic changes occurring in patients affected with movement disorders makes it difficult to generalize EEG markers). Therefore, this multimodal processing is assumed to add accuracy in the prediction of movements, thus improving the effectiveness of the system.","17 Jun 2014","Approved","Carlos M. Gomez, Human Psychobiology Lab, Experimental Psychology Department, University of Seville, Spain","Author Response (F1000Research Advisory Board Member) 24 Apr 2014"," The paper has clearly improved in clarity. As there are no statistics or the determination of an algorithm to predict the intentionality of movement, it is still a step to obtain the goal of controlling tremor by electrical stimulation.The less clear part of the manuscript is the EEG simulation, if they do not have a neuro-muscular model of the tremor and its suppression by beta/alpha ratios is not clear how it is possible to estimate a false positive in the movement prediction. Also the EEG model is a descriptive, not a neurophysiological model.With these reserves and positively scoring the obtained goals by the authors, it is an interesting contribution to find an on-line algorithm for predicting intentional movements in Parkinson diseases.

Continue reading We thank the referee for their criticisms.Introduction:“In Figure 1 the dashed line seemed to indicate the movement, but how it is possible that the movement itself is predicted by the movement kinematic - that should be zero before movement. Except if some thresholds are defined, pre-thresholds movements are the predictors. Please clarify the sentence ""decrement of the rest tremor before movement onset"" - does it means that the reduction in tremor is not the initial voluntary movement but a different neural command which is being inhibited by the voluntary control? Then define physiological characteristics, frequency amplitude, of tremor. Otherwise it would be difficult to distinguish between the reduction of tremor and the initial phases of movement.”The initiation phase of movement in a patient with rest tremor has been characterized in details in the literature (Papengut et al. 2013). In patients exhibiting a rest tremor, tremor suppression at movement onset (reduction in amplitude or complete cessation, detectable with kinematic sensors) is an example of noticeable changes in tremor features occurring at the beginning of the voluntary movement: tremor features change and this is detectable by kinematic analysis. It is presumed that the voluntary command inhibits the central oscillator generating rest tremor. Since we are using both accelerometry and gyroscopes, the beginning of the finger-to-nose movement is clearly identified by changes in kinematics.The introduction and the legend of Figure 1 have been changed. Methods:“""Mean age of the patients was 62 ± 20 years"". It would be more precise to describe the age of each individual subjects. Means are useful for high number of subjects. Same for other parameters.We have included a table detailing age and other parameters in the Methods of the revised article. Patients were followed on a regular basis during this European project. The clinical scores were pretty stable, although slight clinical fluctuations were observed (this is very common in the follow-up of neurological patients exhibiting a tremor in the upper limb). “""After (1) hearing an acoustic signal, the patient (2) prepared themselves mentally for the execution of movement and (3) performed the task."" It is not clear how long it takes this preparation. Was it induced by the experimenter instructions or it was a spontaneous strategy? How long does each of the phases take?”The text has been changed to the following:“Patients were told to keep the most relaxed attitude. After hearing an acoustic signal, they prepared themselves for the execution of movement by mental imagery of the movement. During a single run, the task was repeated about 10 times.” The preparation phase lasted typically between 2 and 8 sec. There was variability between trials depending on self-estimation by patients. This is typical in mental imagery. Some patients are “fast-imagers” and others are “slow-imagers”. “Is it necessary to indicate the files code? Otherwise please suppress it.”This is useful in making the figures more readable (see Figures 7, 9 and 10).  “""EEG signals were sampled at 256 Hz (re-sampling at 1000 Hz for synchronization purposes)."" It seems that the data were re-sampled to a higher frequency. Could it be considered an interpolation rather than a re-sampling? Anyway it would be better to sample at 1000 Hz, if needed.”Yes, we could consider an interpolation and/or a re-sampling. The rationale for the re-sampling at 1000 Hz is that it does not affect the spectral contents in the frequency sub-bands that are particularly of interest in our study. An interpolation technique is an alternative. “Figure 2 is very difficult to follow, maybe doing a composite figure with accelerometer, gyroscopes and magnetometers separated would be better. One example of tremor suppression would be appreciated.”We agree with the referee that this figure might be confusing. We have modified the figure in the revised article. The description of the sensors is reported in Gallego et al. (2010)Sensors are a combination of triaxial accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers. The low weight of IMUs makes them an optimal solution, as tremor changes its characteristics if a larger mass is attached to the limbs. Moreover, their small size does not interfere with user’s movements.The phenomenon of tremor suppression induced by the application of FES has been published earlier. Here is an example of essential tremor responding strongly to FES. This patient does not respond to any medication (including: propranolol, primidone, topiramate). Although refractory to conventional drugs, this patient was FES-sensitive. Figure from:Grimaldi G, Manto M: “Old” and Emerging Therapies of Human Tremor.

The following reference has been added: Pfurtscheller and Lopes da Silva (1999). This methodology is considered as a sound procedure for the detection of the preparation of movement.“""Three time intervals were studied: pre-movement period, movement period, post-movement period. The pre-movement period (lasting 2 seconds) was defined according to the acoustic order given to the patients and the detection of the beginning of movement via the gyroscopes."" Please give a more precise description of the time window analyzed - 2000 ms before the movement? 2000 ms after the auditory signal? In the middle? Was there always 2000 ms between auditory signal and movement?”The following sentence has been added: “by considering 2 seconds back from the point of detection of the beginning of movement. We decided to use a period of 2000 msec based on the available literature which considers that 2 seconds encompasses the preparation phase at the cortical level.” “""The peaks (ß/a and ß²/a ratios) higher than a defined threshold were considered as indicators of a potential voluntary movement"" Was the threshold pre-defined a priori (which value?), or adjusted following the predictive value.”This has been studied earlier. The best thresholding process should be decided in a case-by-case scenario, as described in Giuliana, Mario and Yassin (2011); % of maximum ratio overtime; threshold considering mean and standard deviation of the ratios. “""More than 800 possible EEG/EMG combinations (n=832)"", please clarify the origin of these 832 combinations.""The number of combinations corresponds to 13 EEG channels (excluding the 2 channels for the eyes) and 64 EMG channels (16 EMG channels for each of the 4 muscles of the upper limb)13x64 = 832 combinations “""Where p is the probability of movement and n the number of movements predicted"", please define more precisely the probability of movement.”The text has been changed to the following:“Where p is the probability of movement (true positives) and n the number of movements predicted, as previously described for the EEG QP.” “In general, it would be desirable to have an experimental protocol in which the subjects have the opportunity to decide if he/she wants to move or not. Or still better to go to a more ecological situation in which the subject is instructed to do the finger-to-nose movement at its own pace. And compare false positive and false negative predictions.”Thanks to the acoustic signal, the period of preparation of movement followed by the execution of the task is clearly defined. The patient knows that after the signal (1) he/she has to relax, (2) he/she has to prepare for  the movement, and (3) he/she has to execute it. It is important to note that it is much easier for neurological patients to follow this sequence with an acoustic signal and not to include an additional internal evaluation to move or not to move. The introduction of an additional decision to move or not is a source of complexity, which by itself interferes with the severity of tremor. Some neurological patients have difficulties and show hesitations for self-paced movements. The task is easier with the acoustic cue.

Please report individual subjects' values.""This table shows the individual values. “Figure 3 reports values of QP much lower than the mean values reported in the text. Please clarify.”Figure 3 illustrates the effects of the selection of the sub-band beta upon the quality parameter.

Or, is not the movement pre-threshold predicting the post-threshold movement? Is that the reason why the Y channel is so good predictor of movement? Please clarify. If it is reduction of tremor, please show some examples.”There is very often one channel of the sensor which gives a much better predicting value. This rule can be applied to movement in general and to tremor in particular: one direction is much more informative (this is called the dominant axis). This explains why some groups consider that a single-axis sensor may provide relevant information. “The motivation of the simulation is not clear, because only the EEG can be simulated, not the movement. Please clarify the interest of the simulations study or remove it.”The simulation study is very important in order to have information about the strength of the ERS/ERD phenomenon. This parameter is important to state that a given patient having a strong enough ERS/ERD may be enrolled for a BCI-based therapy. This is a critical step, because some patients will benefit from a BCI-based management, whereas others not. We want to underline that we anticipate that in the near future this methodology will help to select patients for BCI programs. For the moment, some patients are enrolled and perform hours of training without success. An ERS/ERD-based decision to include patients in training programs will render the BCI-based management much more efficient. Discussion:“The discussion seems to clarify that the excellent predictor of reduction of tremor is produced by a different command than the voluntary control. But tremor should have a definite frequency, and this frequency property of the tremor seems not be taken in account in present report.”Tremor parameters have not been taken into account in this paper which is focused on the detection of voluntary movement. The overall concept of this European study was to predict the intentionality of movement and not to track the tremor parameters. FES is supposed to be active on the various forms of tremor. The point raised by the reviewer was addressed in detail in a previous European study (Manto et al., 2003). Tremor is a very dynamic process, but the major advantage of FES is to have a non-selective suppressive effect by acting on the peripheral nervous system. We thank the referee for their criticisms.Introduction:“In Figure 1 the dashed line seemed to indicate the movement, but how it is possible that the movement itself is predicted by the movement kinematic - that should be zero before movement. Except if some thresholds are defined, pre-thresholds movements are the predictors. Please clarify the sentence ""decrement of the rest tremor before movement onset"" - does it means that the reduction in tremor is not the initial voluntary movement but a different neural command which is being inhibited by the voluntary control? Then define physiological characteristics, frequency amplitude, of tremor. Otherwise it would be difficult to distinguish between the reduction of tremor and the initial phases of movement.”The initiation phase of movement in a patient with rest tremor has been characterized in details in the literature (Papengut et al. 2013). In patients exhibiting a rest tremor, tremor suppression at movement onset (reduction in amplitude or complete cessation, detectable with kinematic sensors) is an example of noticeable changes in tremor features occurring at the beginning of the voluntary movement: tremor features change and this is detectable by kinematic analysis. It is presumed that the voluntary command inhibits the central oscillator generating rest tremor. Since we are using both accelerometry and gyroscopes, the beginning of the finger-to-nose movement is clearly identified by changes in kinematics.The introduction and the legend of Figure 1 have been changed. Methods:“""Mean age of the patients was 62 ± 20 years"". It would be more precise to describe the age of each individual subjects. Means are useful for high number of subjects. Same for other parameters.We have included a table detailing age and other parameters in the Methods of the revised article. Patients were followed on a regular basis during this European project. The clinical scores were pretty stable, although slight clinical fluctuations were observed (this is very common in the follow-up of neurological patients exhibiting a tremor in the upper limb). “""After (1) hearing an acoustic signal, the patient (2) prepared themselves mentally for the execution of movement and (3) performed the task."" It is not clear how long it takes this preparation. Was it induced by the experimenter instructions or it was a spontaneous strategy? How long does each of the phases take?”The text has been changed to the following:“Patients were told to keep the most relaxed attitude. After hearing an acoustic signal, they prepared themselves for the execution of movement by mental imagery of the movement. During a single run, the task was repeated about 10 times.” The preparation phase lasted typically between 2 and 8 sec. There was variability between trials depending on self-estimation by patients. This is typical in mental imagery. Some patients are “fast-imagers” and others are “slow-imagers”. “Is it necessary to indicate the files code? Otherwise please suppress it.”This is useful in making the figures more readable (see Figures 7, 9 and 10).  “""EEG signals were sampled at 256 Hz (re-sampling at 1000 Hz for synchronization purposes)."" It seems that the data were re-sampled to a higher frequency. Could it be considered an interpolation rather than a re-sampling? Anyway it would be better to sample at 1000 Hz, if needed.”Yes, we could consider an interpolation and/or a re-sampling. The rationale for the re-sampling at 1000 Hz is that it does not affect the spectral contents in the frequency sub-bands that are particularly of interest in our study. An interpolation technique is an alternative. “Figure 2 is very difficult to follow, maybe doing a composite figure with accelerometer, gyroscopes and magnetometers separated would be better. One example of tremor suppression would be appreciated.”We agree with the referee that this figure might be confusing. We have modified the figure in the revised article. The description of the sensors is reported in Gallego et al. (2010)Sensors are a combination of triaxial accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers. The low weight of IMUs makes them an optimal solution, as tremor changes its characteristics if a larger mass is attached to the limbs. Moreover, their small size does not interfere with user’s movements.The phenomenon of tremor suppression induced by the application of FES has been published earlier. Here is an example of essential tremor responding strongly to FES. This patient does not respond to any medication (including: propranolol, primidone, topiramate). Although refractory to conventional drugs, this patient was FES-sensitive. Figure from:Grimaldi G, Manto M: “Old” and Emerging Therapies of Human Tremor.

The following reference has been added: Pfurtscheller and Lopes da Silva (1999). This methodology is considered as a sound procedure for the detection of the preparation of movement.“""Three time intervals were studied: pre-movement period, movement period, post-movement period. The pre-movement period (lasting 2 seconds) was defined according to the acoustic order given to the patients and the detection of the beginning of movement via the gyroscopes."" Please give a more precise description of the time window analyzed - 2000 ms before the movement? 2000 ms after the auditory signal? In the middle? Was there always 2000 ms between auditory signal and movement?”The following sentence has been added: “by considering 2 seconds back from the point of detection of the beginning of movement. We decided to use a period of 2000 msec based on the available literature which considers that 2 seconds encompasses the preparation phase at the cortical level.” “""The peaks (ß/a and ß²/a ratios) higher than a defined threshold were considered as indicators of a potential voluntary movement"" Was the threshold pre-defined a priori (which value?), or adjusted following the predictive value.”This has been studied earlier. The best thresholding process should be decided in a case-by-case scenario, as described in Giuliana, Mario and Yassin (2011); % of maximum ratio overtime; threshold considering mean and standard deviation of the ratios. “""More than 800 possible EEG/EMG combinations (n=832)"", please clarify the origin of these 832 combinations.""The number of combinations corresponds to 13 EEG channels (excluding the 2 channels for the eyes) and 64 EMG channels (16 EMG channels for each of the 4 muscles of the upper limb)13x64 = 832 combinations “""Where p is the probability of movement and n the number of movements predicted"", please define more precisely the probability of movement.”The text has been changed to the following:“Where p is the probability of movement (true positives) and n the number of movements predicted, as previously described for the EEG QP.” “In general, it would be desirable to have an experimental protocol in which the subjects have the opportunity to decide if he/she wants to move or not. Or still better to go to a more ecological situation in which the subject is instructed to do the finger-to-nose movement at its own pace.

The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.","IntroductionAnimals provide benefits to humans through ecosystem services including the provision of food and fibre, crop pollination, biological control, waste disposal, nutrient cycling and seed dispersal1–5. Animal behaviour also inflicts costs on humanity, particularly through damage to food crops grown for human consumption6–9. The monetary value of the benefits and costs of animal activity can be substantial. For example, Losey and Vaughan10 estimated that the annual value of wild pollinators to agriculture in the United States (US) was approximately US$3 billion, while natural pest control services were worth about US$13.6 billion annually. Conversely, crop damage caused by the European starling (Sturnus vulgaris) in the US costs around US$800 million each year11, while bird damage to horticultural production in Australia is estimated at AUD$300 million annually12.Despite the obvious cost-benefit trade-offs of animal activity, studies on the ecosystem services provided by animals and on the damage they cause have evolved largely independently13. Yet, to more accurately reflect the outcomes of animal activity for society, it is imperative to quantify and compare the costs and benefits of these activities in the same system. Cost-benefit trade-offs are most acute in agricultural systems14, which profit from a range of animal-based ecosystem services, but suffer also from substantial negative impacts from animal activity.The net return associated with animal activity in a given system can be derived by subtracting the costs of this activity (damage inflicted) from the benefits (ecosystem services provided). Benefits and costs may be quantified in monetary terms or some other appropriate metric (e.g. net effect on crop yield). A net return can be either positive or negative depending on the difference between the value of the ecosystem service(s) and the value of the negative impact(s). This approach is fundamentally different to other cost-benefit trade-offs presented in the literature, such as trading off the cost of supporting ecosystem service providers (e.g. by planting or protecting their habitat) against the value of the services provided15, or comparing the cost of pest control strategies with the amount of damage inflicted by pests16. Conceptually, it is most similar to circumstances where particular animals inflict damage (e.g. insect pests), other animals help control these pests (e.g. insectivorous birds), and researchers compare crop yield with and without the ecosystem service providers (e.g. Mols and Visser2, and Kellerman3). Focussing on net return, however, shifts the emphasis to quantifying both the costs and the benefits of the activity of particular animals, subtracting one from the other, and includes cost-benefit trade-offs stemming from the activity of the same species or the same group of species.Quantifying net returns is applicable to many situations within agriculture and more broadly (Figure 1). For example, pollinating insects contribute substantially to the pollination of food crops17, but the same insects may also pollinate agricultural weeds18. In a given location, the net return of pollinator activity could be quantified by comparing crop yield from pollination vs. reductions in yield caused by competition from insect-pollinated weeds. Similarly, insectivorous animals may help control insect pests in crops2, but could also consume desirable insect species (e.g. pollinators)19. An analysis of insectivore activity, diet composition, and changes in crop yield with variation in animal activity and abundance could be conducted to quantify this cost-benefit trade-off.Figure 1. The same animal activity can confer benefits and costs on society.These cost-benefit trade-offs are common across nature. A positive net return from animal activity occurs when benefits outweigh costs, with the converse resulting in a negative net return.

Remaining photos are from thinstockphotos.co.uk.In this study, I present the first ever field test of this net return approach by quantifying the economic costs and benefits of bird activity in almond orchards in southern Australia (Figure 2). Almonds are one of Australia’s fastest growing horticulture sectors. The area of almond plantations increased 5-fold between 2001 and 2011, from 5,900 ha to over 30,000 ha, and annual production is projected to reach 88,000 tonnes in 2016, up from 37,000 tonnes in 2011 (http://www.australianalmonds.com.au/industry). Australia will soon be the world’s second largest almond producer behind California, USA.Figure 2.

Photo credits: Hugh McGregor and Shannon Triplett.The expansion of the almond industry raises substantial production and conservation management challenges. In Australia, almond crops attract a number of native bird species, especially parrots, which eat almonds during the growing season and reduce crop yield20. However, the same bird species provide an ecosystem service to growers by eating residual nuts left on trees after the main crop has been harvested. These so-called ‘mummified nuts’ (mummy nuts) are susceptible to fungal infection, which may threaten future crop yields. Moreover, recent evidence shows that mummified nuts are used intensively by the carob moth (Ectomyelois ceratoniae) for food and breeding (http://australianalmonds.com.au/industry/conference_2012/proceedings). The carob moth is a pest of global significance, impacting the production of numerous crops worldwide including dates, figs, pistachio, citrus and pomegranate21–23. It is a major emerging threat to the Australian almond industry, as it feeds on almond kernels rendering them unsuitable for human consumption. Mechanical or manual removal of mummy nuts post harvest is one approach to controlling moth outbreaks and fungal infections. However, birds are already providing this service to Australian growers – the question addressed in my study is whether the monetary value of this service outweighs the costs of bird damage to almonds, resulting in a positive net return from bird activity.","20 Jun 2014","Approved","Stijn Reinhard, Agriculture Economics and Rural Policy, Wageningen University and Research Center, Netherlands","Author Response (F1000Research Advisory Board Member) 24 Apr 2014"," I agree with most of the responses from Gary Luck.I prefer to persist in my sixth remark on the elaboration of the Generalized Linear Model.

Continue reading I thank Dr Reinhard for taking the time to review this paper, and for his constructive comments on the study. I have responded to each comment below and made changes to the paper where required to address relevant concerns. I believe the current title of my paper is most appropriate given the context of the study. The work I present is not an examination of trading off costs and benefits from ecosystem services. The animal activity in question (eating almonds) is only an ecosystem service in one context. In another context it inflicts costs to growers through damage to almonds pre-harvest. It is very important that this distinction remains clear rather than referring to the activity of eating almonds as just an ecosystem service. I set out the context of the study in the following paragraph: “The expansion of the almond industry raises substantial production and conservation management challenges. In Australia, almond crops attract a number of native bird species, especially parrots, which eat almonds during the growing season and reduce crop yield. However, the same bird species provide an ecosystem service to growers by eating residual nuts left on trees after the main crop has been harvested.

However, birds are already providing this service to Australian growers – the question addressed in my study is whether the monetary value of this service outweighs the costs of bird damage to almonds, resulting in a positive net return from bird activity.” I argue that the results of a net return analysis should be used to guide the level of investment required in animal management in a given system. For example, if the net return of bird activity is positive then it would be unnecessary for growers to invest money in controlling bird activity. I raise this issue and provide an example in the context of the pest control strategy of shooting to scare as follows:“In almond plantations, birds are currently considered pests and are subject to control strategies such as shooting to scare. In my study, shooters were employed for an average of 120 days per season over the growing seasons of 2009/10 and 2010/11. Based on an 8-hr day and minimum wage ($15.96 hr-1), the cost of employing shooters is at least $15,322 season-1. Over a 15,500 ha plantation (the entire plantation estate for my study) this equates to about $1 ha-1, and appears to be a good investment if compared only to the cost of bird damage. For example, if shooting reduces bird damage by only 1% it would save growers $22.19 ha-1. Yet, in the context of an overall positive net return from bird activity, the investment in shooting may be completely unnecessary.”  Please see my response to Point #2 from Dr Nelson's review, and the new text I have added in regards to the problems associated with netting whole trees. It was not my aim to analyse differences in bird activity with or without shooting to scare birds. It is well recognised that shooting to scare has minimal impact on bird activity (see citations 20, 26 and 27) as they quickly become habituated to this practice. Attempting a controlled experiment with and without shooting would be extremely difficult in my study area given shooting is conducted on an ad hoc basis and the sound of a gunshot travels large distances (and hence would compromise any ‘treatment’ sites supposedly free of shooting activity). Unfortunately, this detailed information is not recorded in a systematic way by growers and differs across different farms. Therefore, it was more appropriate to use the conservative estimate I included in my analysis, with the examination of how net returns vary under different cost and benefit scenarios (Figure 5 and related text). I discuss this issue at some length in the second paragraph of the Discussion, but I have added the following new text to clarify the issue further:“Nevertheless, if the acceptable quantity of mummy nuts that can be retained per tree is substantially higher than two, then the cost of mummy nut removal by growers is reduced even further.” I have expanded on the description of the edge/interior comparison and its related statistical analysis as follows:“A total of 120 trees were included in the experiment with 60 netted trees (treatment) and 60 open trees (control). Thirty netted trees and 30 open trees were located at the edge of almond blocks (the exterior two rows) and 30 netted trees and 30 open trees were located in the interior of almond blocks (the centre point furthest from the edge – approximately 300 m). An edge/interior contrast was included because bird activity tends to be highest close to block edges. Control and treatment trees were assigned systematically to maximize interspersion, and I maintained a minimum distance of four trees between each control and treatment in the same edge or interior row to avoid adjacency effects and spatial autocorrelation in damage impacts (e.g. netted trees impacting outcomes on non-netted trees).”“I determined if there was a block or row location (edge/interior) effect on nut loss attributed to birds or non-bird factors pre- and post-harvest using a generalized linear model with a binomial response. In this case, the binomial outcome was either nut damaged/lost vs. nut intact. That is, I compared nut outcome among almond blocks and edge and interior rows pre-harvest and post-harvest for open trees where the outcome could be either nut damaged/lost to bird activity or nut remained intact. I conducted the same analysis for netted trees pre- and post-harvest where nut outcome was affected by non-bird factors (e.g. wind). Row location was nested within block for these analyses and both were treated as random factors and p = 0.05 was considered statistically significant.” Does the referee mean other almond orchards or other horticultural orchards? I don’t claim that the specific results I present are going to be transferable across a range of situations. That was never my intention. The aim of the paper is to present a case study of cost-benefit trade-offs from the activity of a given suite of animals. I do argue, however, that calculating the net return from animal activity in agro-ecosystems should be much more widely applied. Currently, research on ecosystem services mostly ignores the costs of animal activity, and research on animal pests largely ignores the benefits of animal activity. This has to change for a more holistic understanding of the outcomes of animal behaviour in different agricultural landscapes.I've added the following new text to the Discussion to make this clearer (second to last paragraph):“The specific results of the case study I present here may not be transferable across different contexts. Nevertheless, the need to calculate a net return from animal activity is broadly relevant because there are few situations in nature whereby the activity of animals in a given location is entirely beneficial or entirely detrimental – especially when considering a broad range of taxa.” See my response to Point #4 from Dr Nelson in regards to varying the market price of almonds including new text and new trend lines in Figure 5. Figure 5 shows trends in net returns given different labour costs, bird damage rates, time spent hand poling, different mechanical shaker rates etc. This is a great point and one I tried to highlight with the final paragraph of my Discussion as follows:<U+200B>“I've focused on a small suite of species and a single activity to clearly illustrate the net return from animal activity. Analyses could be extended to encompass more species and more activities, dependent on available ecological knowledge. For example, I have recorded 35 insectivorous bird species using almond orchards in my study area that may contribute to controlling carob moth. Almond flowers require cross pollination to set seed, and in north-west Victoria, over 100,000 European honeybee (Apis mellifera) hives are trucked into almond plantations each year, costing growers more than $7 million annually. Yet, almost nothing is known of the potential contribution that native pollinators could make to almond pollination in this region. A more complete analysis could consider the costs and benefits, and ultimately net return, of the activities of a range of species.” I thank Dr Reinhard for taking the time to review this paper, and for his constructive comments on the study.

Therefore, it was more appropriate to use the conservative estimate I included in my analysis, with the examination of how net returns vary under different cost and benefit scenarios (Figure 5 and related text). I discuss this issue at some length in the second paragraph of the Discussion, but I have added the following new text to clarify the issue further:“Nevertheless, if the acceptable quantity of mummy nuts that can be retained per tree is substantially higher than two, then the cost of mummy nut removal by growers is reduced even further.” I have expanded on the description of the edge/interior comparison and its related statistical analysis as follows:“A total of 120 trees were included in the experiment with 60 netted trees (treatment) and 60 open trees (control). Thirty netted trees and 30 open trees were located at the edge of almond blocks (the exterior two rows) and 30 netted trees and 30 open trees were located in the interior of almond blocks (the centre point furthest from the edge – approximately 300 m). An edge/interior contrast was included because bird activity tends to be highest close to block edges. Control and treatment trees were assigned systematically to maximize interspersion, and I maintained a minimum distance of four trees between each control and treatment in the same edge or interior row to avoid adjacency effects and spatial autocorrelation in damage impacts (e.g. netted trees impacting outcomes on non-netted trees).”“I determined if there was a block or row location (edge/interior) effect on nut loss attributed to birds or non-bird factors pre- and post-harvest using a generalized linear model with a binomial response. In this case, the binomial outcome was either nut damaged/lost vs. nut intact. That is, I compared nut outcome among almond blocks and edge and interior rows pre-harvest and post-harvest for open trees where the outcome could be either nut damaged/lost to bird activity or nut remained intact. I conducted the same analysis for netted trees pre- and post-harvest where nut outcome was affected by non-bird factors (e.g. wind). Row location was nested within block for these analyses and both were treated as random factors and p = 0.05 was considered statistically significant.” Does the referee mean other almond orchards or other horticultural orchards? I don’t claim that the specific results I present are going to be transferable across a range of situations. That was never my intention. The aim of the paper is to present a case study of cost-benefit trade-offs from the activity of a given suite of animals. I do argue, however, that calculating the net return from animal activity in agro-ecosystems should be much more widely applied. Currently, research on ecosystem services mostly ignores the costs of animal activity, and research on animal pests largely ignores the benefits of animal activity. This has to change for a more holistic understanding of the outcomes of animal behaviour in different agricultural landscapes.I've added the following new text to the Discussion to make this clearer (second to last paragraph):“The specific results of the case study I present here may not be transferable across different contexts. Nevertheless, the need to calculate a net return from animal activity is broadly relevant because there are few situations in nature whereby the activity of animals in a given location is entirely beneficial or entirely detrimental – especially when considering a broad range of taxa.” See my response to Point #4 from Dr Nelson in regards to varying the market price of almonds including new text and new trend lines in Figure 5. Figure 5 shows trends in net returns given different labour costs, bird damage rates, time spent hand poling, different mechanical shaker rates etc. This is a great point and one I tried to highlight with the final paragraph of my Discussion as follows:<U+200B>“I've focused on a small suite of species and a single activity to clearly illustrate the net return from animal activity. Analyses could be extended to encompass more species and more activities, dependent on available ecological knowledge. For example, I have recorded 35 insectivorous bird species using almond orchards in my study area that may contribute to controlling carob moth. Almond flowers require cross pollination to set seed, and in north-west Victoria, over 100,000 European honeybee (Apis mellifera) hives are trucked into almond plantations each year, costing growers more than $7 million annually. Yet, almost nothing is known of the potential contribution that native pollinators could make to almond pollination in this region. A more complete analysis could consider the costs and benefits, and ultimately net return, of the activities of a range of species.” Competing Interests: None Close REPORT A CONCERN"

However, contradictory data2 and lack of firm evidence3 makes it difficult to firmly establish its actual significance in this process (see López-Otín et al.4 for a recent review). One important aspect that requires further clarification in this regard is the relationship between oxidative stress and insulin peptides, a well conserved family of hormones firmly linked to aging. Extensive work in vertebrates and invertebrates indicates that the insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I)/insulin signalling (IIS) pathway has a negative impact on aging. It has been argued that this detrimental action is mediated by reducing cell defences to oxidative stress5–7 which, in turn is harmful for neuronal survival1. However, IGF-I has been shown to be largely neuroprotective8, even in conditions such as ischemic injury or brain trauma where oxidative stress is most likely a major pathogenic mechanism9. Thus, it is unclear whether or not IGF-I protects the brain against oxidative stress as the current evidence is contradictory.A possible explanation for these apparently contradictory observations may be that modulation of the cellular response to oxidative stress by IGF-I is cell-dependent10. Until now, only neurons have been studied in this regard. However, astrocytes, a major cellular element of the brain, are essential contributors to neuronal homeostasis and are coupled to neurons in the response to oxidative stress in order to help protect them11. It is thus possible that IGF-I participates in the response of astrocytes to oxidative stress as part of the overall brain response encompassing all types of brain cells, not only neurons. Contrary to what we previously observed in neurons12, we report here that IGF-I protects astrocytes against oxidative stress and, very significantly, also co-operates with astrocytes to protect neurons.","01 May 2014","Approved","Marta Margeta, Department of Pathology, University of California San Francisco, USA","Author Response 09 May 2014"," In the revised article, the authors have addressed most of my concerns. There still remain a few relatively minor issues, mostly involving data presentation / manuscript readability rather than scientific validity.As in the prior version of the manuscript, the authors claim in Fig. 8 (model figure) that IGF-1 has a neuroprotective effect under basal conditions (i.e. in the absence of H2O2) and now explicitly cite Fig. 3A in support of this claim. However, as previously, Fig. 3A includes no information on the statistical significance of IGF-1 effect on the neuronal death in the absence of H2O2 (by eye, the IGF-1 effect seems very modest). In the legend for Fig. 3A, the authors state that ""#"" means ""p<0.05 vs control"" but symbol ""#"" is not used in the figure - perhaps it has been accidentally omitted? I appreciate that, as I suggested, the authors repeated statistical analyses for many experiments and are now using two-way rather than one-way ANOVA where appropriate. However, the results of this analysis are buried in the figure legends and are described in a fairly non-transparent, difficult to understand way; the figures themselves are largely unmodified. To make the paper more accessible to future readers, the graphs for experiments analyzed by 2-way ANOVA should show statistical significance for all post-hoc comparisons that were performed (including the effects that were not significant, to make this clear); for a 2x2 experimental condition grid this means all 4 post-hoc comparisons should be shown in terms of statistical significance. As an example, for the experiment in Fig. 2B, the authors should show statistical significance for (1) H2O2 vs vehicle in control; (2) H2O2 vs. vehicle following PPP pre-treatment; (3) control vehicle vs. PPP vehicle; and (4) control H2O2 vs. PPP H2O2. Analogous pairwise comparisons should be shown for all experiments using 2-way ANOVA. I have read this submission.

Nevertheless there is now a growing recognition of the widespread occurrence and functional significance of cytoplasmic nanospaces in cells from species across several kingdoms3–9.In this respect, membrane-membrane junctions between lysosomes and the sarcoplasmic reticulum (L-SR junctions) are of particular interest; not least because they have been hypothesized to couple calcium signaling between these two organelles10,11.That L-SR junctions may play an important role in cellular Ca2+ signaling was uncovered through early studies on the Ca2+ mobilizing messenger nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP)12, which demonstrated that NAADP released Ca2+ from a store other than the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum (S/ER)13, that could then trigger further Ca2+ release from the S/ER by Ca2+- induced Ca2+ release (CICR)14–17. A major advance in our understanding was then provided by the demonstration that the NAADP-released Ca2+ was from an acidic lysosome-related store10,18,19 in a manner that requires two pore segment channel subtype 2 (TPC2)20. However, studies on pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) had also identified a significant specialization, namely L-SR nanojunctions. It was hypothesized not only that these nanojunctions were necessary for coupling between lysosomes and the SR, but that they could both coordinate and restrict their relationship to the SR by preferentially targeting ryanodine receptors while excluding inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptors10,11. Importantly, NAADP-dependent Ca2+ bursts primarily arise from lysosomes in the perinuclear region of PASMCs and appear to promote rapid, local Ca2+ transients that are of sufficient size to activate clusters of SR resident ryanodine receptor subtype 3 (RyR3) and thus initiate, in an all-or-none manner, a propagating global Ca2+ wave10,11.The specialization of the proposed L-SR junction is likely important in smooth muscle cell physiology, e.g., in vasomotion, and in the recycling of organelles and programmed cell death by autophagy21. However, L-SR junctions may also make as yet unforeseen contributions to vascular pathologies as highlighted by the fact that Niemann-Pick disease type C1 results, in part, from dysregulation of lysosomal Ca2+ handling22 and is known to precipitate portal hypertension23, while other lysosomal storage diseases (e.g., Pompe and Gaucher disease) accelerate pulmonary arterial hypertension24,25. Moreover, observed hypertension is often associated with dysfunction of cholesterol trafficking26, increased plasma cholesterol levels, vascular lesion formation, atherosclerosis/thrombosis and medial degradation23,27. Therefore lysosomal Ca2+ signaling is of considerable clinical interest. That L-SR junctions may be of further significance to pathology is also evident, for example, from the fact that in the pulmonary artery smooth muscle L-SR junctions underpin Ca2+ waves initiated by endothelin 1, the levels of which are elevated in pulmonary hypertension, systemic hypertension and atherosclerosis28,29. An understanding of how specific Ca2+ signals are functionally initiated therefore has important translational implications.Lysosomal Ca2+ regulation has been of current interest in several recent research and review articles (e.g.,30–34), yet a quantitative elucidation of the mechanism by which Ca2+ signals are generated by the endolysosomal system is still lacking. Given the likely importance of L-SR junctions to Ca2+ signaling in health and disease, we sought to determine whether this nano-environment would indeed be able to effectively generate the previously observed NAADP-induced Ca2+ signals. In particular, we set out to verify the following hypotheses in PASMCs: (1) L-SR nanojunctions should be observable in the ultrastructure of these cells, (2) NAADP induces sufficient Ca2+ release from the lysosome to initiate activation of RyR3 embedded in the junctional SR, and (3) the combined effect of activation of L-SR nanojunctions in a cytoplasmic “trigger zone” determines the threshold of global [Ca2+]i for the biphasic release process.Due to the minute spatial scale of the nanojunctions generating the primary Ca2+ signals, accurate investigation of dynamic signaling within these spaces cannot be achieved with currently available instrumentation. To overcome this issue, we took an integrative approach by combining our own electron microscopy of L-SR nanojunctions, existing kinetic data on the Ca2+ transporters and buffers, and prior knowledge of the NAADP-induced Ca2+ signal features into a quantitative model of a typical L-SR nanojunction. This model is based on stochastic simulations of intracellular Ca2+ diffusion by Brownian motion implemented using the particle simulator MCell35–37.In the present manuscript we have verified the existence of L-SR nanojunctions within the ultrastructure of PASMCs, and shown that lysosomes can release sufficient Ca2+ to activate CICR via RyR3 clusters embedded in the junctional SR. Perhaps most importantly, we show that L-SR coupling is determined both by the integrity of L-SR junction on the nanoscale and the quantal summation of Ca2+ release from multiple, activated junctional complexes.","27 Jun 2014","Not Approved","Fan Zhang, Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Medical College of Virginia Campus, Virginia Commonwealth University, USA","Author Response 04 Dec 2014"," NAADP mediated two-phase Ca2+ release responses were observed in smooth muscle cells, including pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). Lysosomes and sarcoplasmic reticulum (L-SR) junctions had been proposed as the structural bases in facilitating local lysosomal Ca2+ bursts (first phase) followed by whole cell Ca2+ release responses from SR (second phase) through a calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) mechanism. In their studies reported here, Nicola Fameli et al. attempted to define the L-SR junctions in PASMCs with a nano-level resolution using electron microscopy (EM), and proceeded to build a quantitative L-SR junctional model. Unfortunately, all these efforts will add little to our further understanding of these L-SR junctional structures, if not at all, due to the lack of solid experimental EM results in reconstructing L-SR junctions, some dogmatic presumptions in L-SR model build up, the inadequacy of validation of the model and a failure to include information on the current disputes over the identity of NAADP-associated Ca2+ release channels in lysosomes. Some major concerns are as follows: Data are not convincing and lack quality. In defining L-SR junctions, the assurance of lysosome and SR identities is fundamental. Immune-gold staining has been widely applied in EM studies to ascertain different cell organelles as well as to conduct 3D reconstruction of cell structure 1 2. However, such a standard practice was excluded in this study as a ‘precaution’ to prevent compromising lysosome membrane definition. In line with applying empirical judgments for identifying organelles to the EM data analysis, the authors extrapolated the opposing and proximal organelles adjacent to the nucleus as lysosomes and SR, and deemed them to be worth studying (Figure 2). In addition, the authors stated that there were few lysosomes found in the subplasmalemmal region, which implied that L-SR junctions were profoundly located around the nucleus. However, the fura-2 fluorescence images in Figure 1 as well as in the two citations used as basis of this study (10,11)3 4 exclusively demonstrated that the first phase lysosomal Ca2+ release initiated from a region around the cell membrane, suggesting that L-SR junctions should have cytoplasmic locations near the plasma membrane. It is clear that more reliable methods such as immune-gold staining are needed to resolve the contradictions over their own results. The modeling is based on many assumed parameters and lacks reliable validation. To establish the L-SR nanojunctional model, the present study has introduced many assumptions to some critical parameters such as the distance between the lysosome and SR, the size of lysosome, and total number of lysosomes; many of which lack proper judgments. In the abstract section, the authors rationalized the application of EM in investigating L-SR junctions by stating “L-SR junction membrane separation has been estimated to be < 400 nm and thus beyond the resolution of light microscopy”. In defining the L-SR nanojunctions, they declared that lysosomes and SR “must be separated by a distance of approximately 20 nm and be of the order of a few hundred nm in lateral dimensions” by citing PM-SR junctions studies (10, 11)3 4. However, these two citations originated from the light microscope-based studies of L-SR junctions by the same group. Given the resolution limitation, these light microscopy results have no way to give an estimation as accurate as 20 nm. It is therefore confusing to find that these references fail to back up such claims, in my opinion. In reference 39 5, it has been proposed that the extracellular Ca2+ entered the cell through Na+/ Ca2+ exchanges, traversed PM-SR junctions to refill SR via Ca2+-ATPase and sustained cell Ca2+ oscillations. For the current L-SR model, this PM-SR modeling may be used as a comparison or reference system leading to the conclusion “that L-SR had a similar 20 nm gap measured as that in PM-SR junctions.” Given that there are no similarities of PM-SR to L-SR junctions, in terms of potency of Ca2+ movement due to Ca2+ gradient across PM and lysosomal membrane, biophysical property of Na+/ Ca2+ exchangers and TPC2 channels, and the actions of Ca2+-ATPase and RyR3 Ca2+ receptors, such a conclusion is not reliable from the modeling. In addition, a major concern is that this model is too simplistic as it excludes many other Ca2+ regulatory mechanisms in both lysosomes and SR, which may influence the accuracy of junction width or prediction in modeling. Some assumptions contradict well-established concepts due to a lack of consideration of lysosome biology. In explaining the shoulder Ca2+ signal (Figure 1), the authors introduced up to four assumptions and calculated that ~60-100 lysosomes were needed to generate this shoulder peak. They verified these lysosome numbers with their TEM images that “can expect a total of about 110 lysosomes/cell”. Considering these two calculations however, it is obviously problematic because almost all lysosomes (100 out of 110 each cell) will need to functionally contribute to the L-SR junctional structure formation. In addition, TEM measurements showed the lysosome dimensions (Table 1) to be major axis of 398 ± 91 nm and minor axis of 325 ± 65 nm. Given the L-SR junction model features “junctional membrane separation and extension are about 15 nm and 300 nm”, it could be postulated that all the lysosomes that participated in L-SR structure formation also have to align well with the SR in order to produce a 300 nm junctional extension. Therefore, this L-SR model actually describes a scenario whereby in PASMCs the majority of lysosomes act as the components of L-SR junctions and uniformly have impeccable arrangements to oppose the SR at 20 nm apart. However, this idealistic model largely contradicts the well-established concepts that lysosomes are active organelles that dynamically exert their different functions by their movements and other activities. TPCs as lysosomal Ca2+ release channels are questionable. In quantifying the L-SR model, the authors arbitrarily assumed TPC2 as the only lysosomal NADDP-activated Ca2+ channel by totally disregarding recent findings that TPC2 is not a lysosomal NAADP-associated Ca2+ channel, but a Na+ channel6, 7 . They also ignored the contribution of other lysosomal channels or transporters that may contribute to such L-SR junction activity. This prejudice in channel selection inevitably invites doubts on the reliability of this proposed L-SR model. In addition, the authors collectively adopted electrophysiological data from other research groups without taking into consideration any incompatibilities with the model. For example, in obtaining the total number of TPC2 channels on a lysosome, the authors “…dividing the macroscopic whole lysosome conductance, calculated from the current values reported in a recent study on TPC2-mediated Ca2+ current in isolated lysosomes (48) 8, by the single channel conductances(45) 9, thus estimating that a typical lysosomal membrane may contain ~20 TPC2”. Unfortunately, the lysosomes used in the whole lysosome conductance recording were not normal lysosomes, but lysosomes manipulated by overexpression of TPC2 and were undergoing size enlargement. With these changes, the modified lysosomes would have a much higher TPC2 conductance compared with normal lysosomes with a natural biogenesis. It is important to use a TPC2 conductance and other parameters of channels from lysosomes of normal cells without an artificial transgene for such modeling. Otherwise, the modeling prediction will be inaccurate and the relevance of such a model will be vague.           In conclusion; aside from the issue that the current L-SR nanojunction model fails to contribute any new insights to our understanding of the L-SR architecture, my concerns over the reliability of data and modelling parameters are rather serious – this work is therefore ‘Not Approved’ in its current version. References1.

The references this reviewer provides only corroborate our point. As explained in detail by first reference, SEM is less appropriate in this kind of study for a number of reasons: 1) One would need to expose lysosomes buried underneath the PM to visualize their surface membrane. This, as the article suggests, is best done by isolating the organelles. Hardly a technique that can serve the purpose of identifying L-SR junctions, whether we use immuno-gold or not; (2) As is evident from Fig 3 of the second reference, therein no membranes were visible in the micrograph with immuno-gold labeling.""In line with applying empirical judgments for identifying organelles to the EM data analysis, the authors extrapolated the opposing and proximal organelles adjacent to the nucleus as lysosomes and SR, and deemed them to be worth studying (Figure 2).""Figure 2, as clearly explained in the text, contains some representative examples from our set of micrographs, but even from the subset in Fig. 2 it is evident that we did not only consider regions neighbouring the nucleus in our survey. This reviewer's statement that “the authors extrapolated the opposing and proximal organelles adjacent to the nucleus as lysosomes and SR” mistakenly implies that the authors simply picked any two objects whose membrane were close enough to be deemed a junctional complex between lysosome and SR. This was most certainly not the case, as explained in detail in the article. The authors can add however that, in spite of our own laboratory's proven experience in electron microscopy (see for example references 39, 56, 57, 92, 98 in our article), we consulted with an expert in the field of electron microscopy, Prof. David Walker, and drew his immense (>30 years) experience (including smooth muscle) to our own.

First, the typical diameter and length of vascular smooth muscle cells are about 5 µm and 150 µm, respectively, which ensures that even so-called perinuclear lysosomes are never too far from the periphery. This fact alone would break the apparent contradiction raised. Moreover, the definition of cell periphery that one can gather from fluorescence measurements can easily cover more than 500 nm in depth. Therefore, at lower resolution fluorescence signals could appear close to the membrane yet be generated by perinuclear lysosomes.""2.

None of the stated parameters was assumed, as should be clear upon reading the article. The L-SR distance was measured, not assumed. The size of the lysosomes observed in micrographs was measured, not assumed. The total number of lysosomes was estimated from our observations, not assumed. We find it difficult to see where proper judgment is lacking, at least with respect to our contribution.

Nevertheless let us provide the best rebuttal possible under these circumstances, and address the somewhat confusing comments made by this reviewer in terms of considerations of the relationship between junctional architecture and the biophysical properties of channels and transporters within different junctions. We measured the distance of observed junctional widths between lysosomes and the sarcoplasmic reticulum with closely apposed “junctional” membranes. The calculated average for the size of measured junctional width was not significantly different from the averaged size of PM-SR junctions previously published and cited in this manuscript. We draw the reader to this striking similarity, and relate this to the capacity of the “nanojunction” to hold and concentrate released calcium. In this respect the precise behaviour of each junction will of course be determined by the density and biophysical properties of local pumps and channels, much like the behaviours vary between other previously defined nanojunctions."" In addition, a major concern is that this model is too simplistic as it excludes many other Ca2+ regulatory mechanisms in both lysosomes and SR, which may influence the accuracy of junction width or prediction in modeling.""It is always best to start with a minimal model and to make the least number of assumptions possible while not compromising the capacity to inform by way of outcomes. This is what the authors delivered. A more complex model would require the addition of a far greater number of assumptions and, in some cases, these would be difficult to justify. Given earlier comments by this reviewer regarding the limitations of assumptions, it is surprising that such minima are not better appreciated, not least because the model in its current form is sufficient to verify a hypothesis based on a substantial body of peer reviewed work (ref. 10, 11 in the article). As the strength of supporting experimental data grows, it would of course be beneficial to the field if the present model were developed further to incorporate other “regulatory mechanisms” to assess with greater accuracy these and similar signalling mechanisms that lie beyond the reach of current technologies.""3. Some assumptions contradict well-established concepts due to a lack of consideration of lysosome biology. In explaining the shoulder Ca2+ signal (Figure 1), the authors introduced up to four assumptions and calculated that ~60-100 lysosomes were needed to generate this shoulder peak.""In constructing quantitative (computational) models, and particularly with respect to those that are applied to systems beyond the resolution of current technologies, one is necessarily required to make justified assumptions. All assumptions made are both appropriate and plausible, and are justified by reference to the literature.""They verified these lysosome numbers with their TEM images that “can expect a total of about 110 lysosomes/cell”. Considering these two calculations however, it is obviously problematic because almost all lysosomes (100 out of 110 each cell) will need to functionally contribute to the L-SR junctional structure formation.""This is a biased reading of our findings, in that we suggest that a range of 60 to 100 lysosomes would have to contribute to the shoulder magnitude, under our model’s conditions, not exactly 100.""In addition, TEM measurements showed the lysosome dimensions (Table 1) to be major axis of 398 ± 91 nm and minor axis of 325 ± 65 nm. Given the L-SR junction model features “junctional membrane separation and extension are about 15 nm and 300 nm”, it could be postulated that all the lysosomes that participated in L-SR structure formation also have to align well with the SR in order to produce a 300 nm junctional extension.""This reviewer’s postulate forcing the lysosomes to “align well” does not emerge naturally from our model. Would this reviewer explain what relationship between the size of the observed lysosomes (major and minor axes) and the portion of the lysosomal surface participating in the L-SR junction suggests that “all the lysosomes that participated in L-SR structure formation also have to align well with the SR in order to produce a 300 nm junctional extension”? This is most unclear from this reviewer’s comments. It is instead clear upon reading the article that nothing in our model nor in our conclusions depends on such postulate.""Therefore, this L-SR model actually describes a scenario whereby in PASMCs the majority of lysosomes act as the components of L-SR junctions and uniformly have impeccable arrangements to oppose the SR at 20 nm apart.""This last sentence is a conclusion that this reviewer makes and stems directly from this reviewer’s postulate—which I must re-emphasize we do not make—and not from our model.""However, this idealistic model largely contradicts the well-established concepts that lysosomes are active organelles that dynamically exert their different functions by their movements and other activities.""The contradiction arises from this reviewer postulated interpretation of our findings. We certainly don’t claim anything that goes against the established observations of lysosmal mobility.""4. TPCs as lysosomal Ca2+ release channels are questionable. In quantifying the L-SR model, the authors arbitrarily assumed TPC2 as the only lysosomal NADDP-activated Ca2+ channel by totally disregarding recent findings that TPC2 is not a lysosomal NAADP-associated Ca2+ channel, but a Na+ channel6, 7 . They also ignored the contribution of other lysosomal channels or transporters that may contribute to such L-SR junction activity. This prejudice in channel selection inevitably invites doubts on the reliability of this proposed L-SR model.""The authors used a minimal model to examine junctional communication at the L-SR nanjunction. The designation of TPC2 was supported by the fact that TPC2: (1) Is primarily targeted to lysosomes; (2) Is required to support NAAD-dependent calcium signalling; (3) Has been shown to be permeable to calcium by at least two previous studies. Controversy in the field is not ignored, as the authors cite articles that provide detailed coverage on disputes relating to TPC2 calcium permeability. That there is conflict in the field does not negate the use of data derived from papers that demonstrate calcium permeability of these channels.""In addition, the authors collectively adopted electrophysiological data from other research groups without taking into consideration any incompatibilities with the model. For example, in obtaining the total number of TPC2 channels on a lysosome, the authors “…dividing the macroscopic whole lysosome conductance, calculated from the current values reported in a recent study on TPC2-mediated Ca2+ current in isolated lysosomes (48) 8, by the single channel conductances(45) 9, thus estimating that a typical lysosomal membrane may contain ~20 TPC2”. Unfortunately, the lysosomes used in the whole lysosome conductance recording were not normal lysosomes, but lysosomes manipulated by overexpression of TPC2 and were undergoing size enlargement. With these changes, the modified lysosomes would have a much higher TPC2 conductance compared with normal lysosomes with a natural biogenesis. It is important to use a TPC2 conductance and other parameters of channels from lysosomes of normal cells without an artificial transgene for such modeling. Otherwise, the modeling prediction will be inaccurate and the relevance of such a model will be vague.""The authors used the best evidence available in support of the present model. At no point was it stated that values used were anything more than estimates derived by best practice from cited and peer reviewed research publications by others. Assuming something other than that which can be derived falls in to the realm of unjustifiable assumption. With present information, assuming a higher TPC2 conductance would be just that.""In conclusion; aside from the issue that the current L-SR nanojunction model fails to contribute any new insights to our understanding of the L-SR architecture, my concerns over the reliability of data and modelling parameters are rather serious – this work is therefore ‘Not Approved’ in its current version.""We think that, within the limits of the available techniques and knowledge, our work not only contributes ""new insights to our understanding of the L-SR architecture"", but also a novel approach to the study of nanojunctional signals. Dr. Fan Zhang we respond to your concerns below, by reporting your comments in quotes first and adding our response below them in bold.""Unfortunately, all these efforts will add little to our further understanding of these L-SR junctional structures, if not at all, due to the (1) lack of solid experimental EM results in reconstructing L-SR junctions, (2) some dogmatic presumptions in L-SR model build up, (3) the inadequacy of validation of the model and (4) a failure to include information on the current disputes over the identity of NAADP-associated Ca2+ release channels in lysosomes.""We address points (1) to (4) in detail below (numbering ours).1. ""Data are not convincing and lack quality.""We fully disagree with this statement. Our set of data represents the most complete survey of these structures in vascular smooth muscle currently available in the literature. The micrographs are of high quality with very well defined membranes and identifiable organelles.""In defining L-SR junctions, the assurance of lysosome and SR identities is fundamental. Immune-gold staining has been widely applied in EM studies to ascertain different cell organelles as well as to conduct 3D reconstruction of cell structure 1 2. However, such a standard practice was excluded in this study as a ‘precaution’ to prevent compromising lysosome membrane definition.""Immuno-gold staining was avoided not as a 'precaution', but because, while certainly enabling us to identify the desired organelles, it reduces visualization of their membranes, since the fixing procedure aimed at preserving tissue antigenicity and the staining protocol for label visualization seriously compromise the resolution of membrane structure required for accurate quantitative characterization of the L-SR junctions. The references this reviewer provides only corroborate our point. As explained in detail by first reference, SEM is less appropriate in this kind of study for a number of reasons: 1) One would need to expose lysosomes buried underneath the PM to visualize their surface membrane. This, as the article suggests, is best done by isolating the organelles. Hardly a technique that can serve the purpose of identifying L-SR junctions, whether we use immuno-gold or not; (2) As is evident from Fig 3 of the second reference, therein no membranes were visible in the micrograph with immuno-gold labeling.""In line with applying empirical judgments for identifying organelles to the EM data analysis, the authors extrapolated the opposing and proximal organelles adjacent to the nucleus as lysosomes and SR, and deemed them to be worth studying (Figure 2).""Figure 2, as clearly explained in the text, contains some representative examples from our set of micrographs, but even from the subset in Fig. 2 it is evident that we did not only consider regions neighbouring the nucleus in our survey. This reviewer's statement that “the authors extrapolated the opposing and proximal organelles adjacent to the nucleus as lysosomes and SR” mistakenly implies that the authors simply picked any two objects whose membrane were close enough to be deemed a junctional complex between lysosome and SR. This was most certainly not the case, as explained in detail in the article. The authors can add however that, in spite of our own laboratory's proven experience in electron microscopy (see for example references 39, 56, 57, 92, 98 in our article), we consulted with an expert in the field of electron microscopy, Prof. David Walker, and drew his immense (>30 years) experience (including smooth muscle) to our own. We not only sought and received guidance, but were enlightened with respect to common practices regarding the identification of lysosomes and their junctions with SR.""In addition, the authors stated that there were few lysosomes found in the subplasmalemmal region, which implied that L-SR junctions were profoundly located around the nucleus. However, the fura-2 fluorescence images in Figure 1 as well as in the two citations used as basis of this study (10,11)3 4 exclusively demonstrated that the first phase lysosomal Ca2+ release initiated from a region around the cell membrane, suggesting that L-SR junctions should have cytoplasmic locations near the plasma membrane. It is clear that more reliable methods such as immune-gold staining are needed to resolve the contradictions over their own results.""One does not exclude the other for a couple of reasons. First, the typical diameter and length of vascular smooth muscle cells are about 5 µm and 150 µm, respectively, which ensures that even so-called perinuclear lysosomes are never too far from the periphery. This fact alone would break the apparent contradiction raised. Moreover, the definition of cell periphery that one can gather from fluorescence measurements can easily cover more than 500 nm in depth. Therefore, at lower resolution fluorescence signals could appear close to the membrane yet be generated by perinuclear lysosomes.""2. The modeling is based on many assumed parameters and lacks reliable validation. To establish the L-SR nanojunctional model, the present study has introduced many assumptions to some critical parameters such as the distance between the lysosome and SR, the size of lysosome, and total number of lysosomes; many of which lack proper judgments.""This point raised by the reviewer verges on the ridiculous. None of the stated parameters was assumed, as should be clear upon reading the article. The L-SR distance was measured, not assumed. The size of the lysosomes observed in micrographs was measured, not assumed. The total number of lysosomes was estimated from our observations, not assumed. We find it difficult to see where proper judgment is lacking, at least with respect to our contribution. ""In the abstract section, the authors rationalized the application of EM in investigating L-SR junctions by stating “L-SR junction membrane separation has been estimated to be < 400 nm and thus beyond the resolution of light microscopy”. In defining the L-SR nanojunctions, they declared that lysosomes and SR “must be separated by a distance of approximately 20 nm and be of the order of a few hundred nm in lateral dimensions” by citing PM-SR junctions studies (10, 11)3 4. However, these two citations originated from the light microscope-based studies of L-SR junctions by the same group. Given the resolution limitation, these light microscopy results have no way to give an estimation as accurate as 20 nm. It is therefore confusing to find that these references fail to back up such claims, in my opinion.""We thank the reviewer for drawing our attention to an unfortunate (and clearly confusing) typographical error with respect to in-text numbering of citations. Our intention was to refer to Lee CH et al 2002 and Fameli N et al 2007, or references 92 and 39, respectively, in the present version.

First, it not only abolishes the rats’ innate fear of cat odors, it can also induce attraction to cat odors1–4. This plausibly increases parasite transmission to cats that serve as its definitive hosts. Second, Toxoplasma gondii infection enhances the attractiveness of infected males to females5. Interestingly, enhanced attractiveness could benefit both the parasite and its host. This plausibly increases the parasites’ transmission through sexual and vertical routes5–8 and benefits the hosts by increasing their reproductive opportunities.Host-parasite interaction is typically characterized by significant trade-offs. Behavioral manipulation itself can impose substantial direct and opportunity costs on the parasite9–11. For example, manipulation of innate fear in infected rats is optimized and not maximized12; suggesting that a dynamic balance exists for the parasite between the costs and benefits of the manipulation. From the perspective of the rat host, one of the most important trade-offs is the reproductive benefit obtained from increased attractiveness and the reproductive cost incurred by greater predation. An experimental study of this trade-off would require an ethically tenuous comparison of predation rates between control and infected animals. Another important trade-off for the host arises from the fact that pheromones produced to communicate male attractiveness are openly broadcasted, liable to be used by both the intended female audience and unintended prey or predator species. We examine this trade-off in the current study.House mice are predated by rats. Studies have shown that around 70% of wild rats13,14 kill mice. Mouse-killing or muricide has been shown to be influenced by rearing15, availability of food14 social16 and environmental17 conditions. In addition, mice express an innate fear of rats18,19. This is characterized by the display of defensive behavior, secretion of stress hormones and activation of brain pathways dedicated to defensive behaviors. In fact, exposure to rat urine or even a recombinant rat urinary protein is sufficient to produce aversion in mice20,21, with the presence of an actual rat not being necessary. Interestingly, in the case of rats, exposure to soiled bedding is sufficient for females to infer greater attractiveness of Toxoplasma gondii-infected males5. This suggests enhanced pheromonal production in infected males, which could result in greater kairomonal aversion in mice considering the openly broadcasted nature of urinary signals. Enhanced aversion in prey species could constitute an opportunity cost for the infected rats that need to be ‘traded-off’ with any incremental benefit of enhanced pheromone production. In light of this, we investigated whether Toxoplasma gondii infection increased the kairomonal valence of rat urine to its prey, mice.","30 Apr 2014","Approved","Jaroslav Flegr, Department of Biology, Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic",NA," The authors clearly showed that mice avoid the smell of urine of Toxoplasma infected rats more than the  smell of urine of Toxoplasma free rats. This effect was observed with both fresh and old urine samples, suggesting that non-volatile components of urine were responsible for the phenomenon.Authors used the correct experimental setup and correct techniques, including the statistical methods. I see just one potentially important problem, namely a rather common problem of pseudoreplications. Authors used urine sample mixtures originated from just two Toxoplasma infected rats and from two Toxoplasma free rats. Theoretically, existence of one abnormal urine sample among four samples could give a false positive result of a study. To avoid the problem of pseudoreplications, authors should use urine sample from different rat for each mouse.It would be interesting to test also the reaction of mice on some Toxoplasma infected and Toxoplasma free members of some non-predator species.

It is characterized by re-experiencing the traumatic event, avoidance of trauma reminders and emotional numbing symptoms, and increased arousal1. PTSD frequently co-occurs with other Axis I psychiatric disorders, such as major depressive disorder (MDD2). Patients with both PTSD and depression were found to have more psychological distress and are also more treatment resistant than patients with PTSD or depression alone3–5. Studies have demonstrated that comorbidity between mood and anxiety disorders increases risk for cardiovascular disease, autoimmune diseases and mortality6,7. In addition, depressive symptom severity and comorbidity of MDD are related to poorer executive functioning in PTSD8,9. In order to better prevent, diagnose or treat these disorders it is of importance to determine biological overlap and differences between mood and anxiety disorders, and also the effect of comorbidity. About 48% of PTSD patients were found to have comorbid MDD in a large national survey in the United States2. Therefore, studies investigating the neurobiology of PTSD often comprise patients with and without comorbid MDD. Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated dysfunction of similar brain regions in both PTSD and MDD. That is, PTSD and MDD are both associated with alterations in structure and function of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC10–12). To what extent comorbid MDD contributes to the reported neurobiological alterations of PTSD is yet to be determined.Thus far, two neuroimaging studies have directly investigated differences in PTSD patients with and without comorbid MDD. First, reduced activity of the mPFC and amygdala was found in PTSD patients with comorbid MDD versus PTSD patients without MDD, when fearful faces were presented13. Second, during a symptom provocation paradigm PTSD patients with comorbid MDD had decreased activity in the insula, and increased ACC and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) activation versus PTSD patients without MDD14. In addition, decreased insula activation remained significant after controlling for PTSD severity. One other study has investigated the effects of depressive symptoms in PTSD patients. A positive correlation between depressive symptoms and (para) hippocampal and ventral ACC activity during an emotional memory task was observed in PTSD patients. A fourth fMRI study involving PTSD patients versus both controls and MDD patients found increased activity in several brain areas of PTSD patients including the insula when emotional pictures were presented15.The four studies discussed above were limited by small sample sizes (8 PTSD-MDD, 8 PTSD+MDD13, 11 PTSD-MDD and 15 PTSD+MDD14, 21 PTSD+MDD and 12 PTSD-MDD16, 16 PTSD and 16 MDD15). In addition, these studies investigated neurobiological alterations during emotional tasks, potentially inducing PTSD (and/or depressive) symptoms. It is expected that PTSD and/or MDD symptom provocation induces an altered state in PTSD with or without MDD, which is reflected by alterations in brain activity. Whether regular functioning of the brain in the absence of symptom-inducing stimuli deviates in PTSD with versus without comorbid MDD remains unclear. To our knowledge, functioning of the brain during resting state, without presenting stimuli or requiring task performance, has not been investigated in PTSD patients with and without comorbid MDD. Thus, the effect of comorbid MDD on brain functioning at baseline of PTSD patients deserves further investigation.Here, we investigate the effects of comorbid MDD on resting state functional connectivity in PTSD patients. Since the studies described above indicated that functioning of the ACC distinguishes PTSD with and without MDD during emotional tasks13,14,16, this brain area was chosen as a region of interest. MDD has been associated with alterations in structure17, function18, structural connectivity19, and reduced resting state functional connectivity20–22 of the subgenual ACC in particular, which is a subdivision of the ventral ACC. In addition, subgenual ACC activation and cortical thickness have been associated with symptom improvement in PTSD23,24. Therefore, the subgenual ACC was selected as a more specific region of interest. Second, alterations in activation of the insula also differed between PTSD patients with and without PTSD, even when controlling for PTSD severity14. Furthermore, insula activation distinguished PTSD patients from MDD patients15. Alterations in structure10,25, function10,26, and resting state functional connectivity27,28 have been reported in PTSD patients and MDD patients respectively. Thus, the insula was chosen as a second region of interest. As increased ACC activity was found in PTSD with comorbid MDD, as well as a positive correlation of ACC activity with depressive symptoms, we hypothesize that functional connectivity of the subgenual ACC is increased in PTSD with versus without comorbid MDD. Since insula activity is increased in PTSD versus MDD and insula activity was reduced in PTSD with comorbid MDD versus PTSD without MDD, we expected to find lower insula functional connectivity in PTSD with MDD as compared to PTSD without MDD. In summary, in order to provide more insights into the potential effects of MDD on the neurobiology of PTSD, the present study examined the effects of comorbid MDD on subgenual ACC and insula resting state functional connectivity in PTSD patients.","09 Jun 2014","Approved","Andrew Kemp, Centre for Clinical and Epidemiologic Research, Hospital Universitário, University of São Paulo, Brazil;  Discipline of Psychiatry and School of Physiology, University of Sydney, Australia","Author Response 07 Apr 2014"," I appreciate the authors detailed responses to my earlier comments.

The cingulates have carapaces, i.e., the extinct glyptodonts and giant armadillos, and the living armadillos. Pilosans instead are covered with hair, although some retain bony dermal ossicles. This group contains sloths and anteaters with strikingly different body forms and habits. Four sloth families have extinct representatives, the Mylodontidae, the Megalonychidae, the Megatheriidae and the Nothrotheriidae, and one has only extant members, the Bradypodidae. The anteaters are united in a single family, the Myrmecophagidae (Scott, 1937; Simpson, 1945; McKenna & Bell, 1997).Many early sloths were small and appeared in the Oligocene already as obligate herbivores, albeit retaining morphologic influences from insectivorous or myrmecophagous antecedents. Myrmecophagy specializations in sloth progenitors have been suggested as restricting later group members from developing a feeding apparatus typical of other herbivores (Winge, 1941; Hirschfeld & Webb, 1968; Patterson & Pascual, 1972; Hirschfeld, 1976; Webb, 1985). Some more unusual herbivore characters inherited by sloths are: (1) narrow, greatly elongated skulls, (2) zygomatic arches missing the anteroposterior jugal-squamosal temporal process connection, (3) decreased numbers and types of teeth, (4) simplified shapes for retained teeth, (5) enamel loss, (6) ever-growing teeth, (7) fewer anterior teeth, and (8) a small buccal opening. All of these characters, advantageous to myrmecophages, are disadvantageous to the typical herbivore condition. Another important character inferred in extinct sloths because of their large hyoid apparatuses (Naples, 1987; Naples, 1989), and by comparison with Recent tree sloths (Naples, 1986) and xenarthran anteaters, are large, long and highly mobile tongues which are also characteristic of insectivorous forms (Owen, 1862; MacAlister, 1875; Reeve, 1940; Montgomery, 1985; Naples, 1999).Xenarthrans also vary widely in cranial specializations, perhaps reflecting bulk versus selective feeding strategies. Characters typifying bulk feeding, as in Lestodon and Glossotherium, include a wide a muzzle and predental spout. Sloths considered selective feeders have narrow muzzles and predental spouts longer than wide, such as the scelidotheres (Bargo et al., 2006a; Bargo et al., 2006b). Further specialization for aquatic feeding is noted for Thalassocnus (Muizon et al., 2004).In spite of an odd herbivore morphology, the combined structural and functional features among sloth lineages succeeded sufficiently to permit small sloths to evolve into moderate and large forms. Megatheroids display this tendency most strikingly, with genera ranging from small (sheep-sized) early genera such as Hapalops, to moderate (bear-sized) forms such as Nothrotheriops, and finally, to the giant (elephant-sized) megatheres such as Megatherium and Eremotherium. Recent tree sloths are obligate suspensory arboreal folivores, whereas extinct sloths are considered “ground” sloths. The unique inverted tree sloth locomotion pattern has been cited as evidence of a close phylogenetic relationship between these genera (Webb, 1985). However, uniting the tree sloths in Bradypodidae is now viewed as incorrect, with each genus taxonomically distinct at the family level (Patterson & Pascual, 1972; Webb, 1985; Gaudin, 2004). As such, Bradypus is retained within Bradypodidae while Choleopus is in Megalonychidae. Extinct sloths have been divided into four families, Megalonychidae, Megatheriidae, Nothrotheriidae and Mylodontidae, although these associations partially assume that all are terrestrial (Gaudin & McDonald, 2008). However, some of the small sized extinct species including Hapalops, may have been at least partially arboreal (White, 1993; Pujos et al., 2007). Larger sloths, such as Nothrotheriops, might have been semiarboreal, or as capable of climbing as are bears. Perhaps the young of even the largest species could climb. The living South American Andean spectacled bear, Tremarctos ornatus, may weigh up to 80 kilograms. It is the most arboreal ursid, living mostly in trees, including building nests and sleeping arboreally (Nowak, 1999). Other authors also suggest that some extinct sloths might have been arboreal (Anthony, 1916; Matthew & Paula Couto, 1959; Romer, 1966; Hirschfeld & Webb, 1968; Paula Couto, 1971; Mayo, 1980; Scillato-Yane, 1980; Coombs, 1983; Sherman, 1984; Hirschfeld, 1985; Webb, 1985; White, 1993; Pujos et al., 2007).Many mammalian insectivorous or omnivorous basal stocks evolved specialized lineages; therefore, it is unsurprising that at least one xenarthran group gave rise to herbivorous forms (Winge, 1941; Janis et al., 1998). However, fossil record gaps prevent direct observation of such changes, and the four fossil sloth families are distinct from their earliest appearance. Lacking direct evidence, reconstruction of morphologies that allowed sloth divergence may be modeled by study of evolutionary trends in known xenarthran lineages. Goals of this study include identification of related structural characters, their association into functional complexes, and evaluation of the potential feeding habits of Hapalops.","11 Jun 2014","Approved","David Burnham, Biodiversity Institute, University of Kansas, USA","Author Response 26 Aug 2014"," This is a very good paper and the science is sound. We suggest some minor technical writing issues that need to be addressed (see below). We think the figures could be much improved by making them less busy. Some suggestions were handled as comments, but overall many of the figures could be improved by shifting words out of the figure and into the captions or supporting text. The first two figures in particular have many words, and we think some of the labelled anatomical structures are either unnecessary to label or could be abbreviated to make the figure appear less busy. That being said, the figures are very good and help considerably in making the arguments outlined in the paperSpecifics:Page 2, First Paragraph – The second sentence reads “i.e., the extinct glyptodonts and giant armadillos, and the living armadillos”, instead it should read “i.e., the extinct glyptodonts, extinct giant armadillos, and the living armadillos”. Page 2, Fourth Paragraph – The seventh sentence (“Extinct sloths have been divided…”) is redundant with the first paragraph of the introduction and should be rewritten. Page 2, Fourth Paragraph – In the eighth sentence, “small sized” should be “small-sized”. Page 2, Seventh Paragraph – In the first sentence, it is not clear to what institution “Department of Geology” refers. Furthermore, Table 1 contains a reference to YPM that is not explained in this paragraph. Page 2, Seventh Paragraph – In the second sentence, “adult” does not require quotation marks. Page 3, Table 1 – see previous comment about no explanation for the abbreviation YPM. It will also need to be added to the table caption. Page 4, Figure 1 – The label pointing out the zygomatic arch in Fig. 1A may be unnecessary for the intended audience, and removing the label will clean up the diagram. Furthermore, the label “Temporal” in the lower portion of Fig. 1A doesn’t seem to refer to anything since it lacks an arrow and it is not contained inside the line drawing. Page 7. Figure 4 – The sentence in the figure about the shaded surfaces indicating occlusion is also included in the figure caption and can be removed from the figure itself. Page 12, Figure 8 – I would prefer to read the explanations of the arrows in the figure caption rather than overlaying the figure. Page 13, Sixth Paragraph – The third sentence reads “The relative size, orientation and position of these …” should read “The relative size, orientation, and position of these…”. Page 14, Seventh Paragraph – In the first sentence, “musclehas” should be “muscle has”. Page 15, Twelfth Paragraph – The first sentence (“This muscle group controls the soft palate position and facilitates.”) is an incomplete sentence. Page 16, Fifth Paragraph – The fourth sentence “The fossil record…”  should be referenced. Page 17, First Paragraph – The first sentence ends with “denoting change in habitus”. Is the word “habitus” really the word that was intended? I think the word habit would be preferable. We have read this submission.

Insects pollinate plants to increase global food production, with 35% of global production of crops depending on animal pollinators1,2. Insects also cause significant destruction of crops and food stores3–5. Insects can also transmit fatal diseases such as dengue fever6, malaria7, yellow fever and epidemic typhus8. Insects use olfaction to sense their surroundings and to guide important activities, including feeding, mating and oviposition. This makes the insect olfactory system receptors an attractive target for the chemical control of deleterious insect species.Insects use odorant receptors (ORs) to recognize and distinguish a diverse range of odorants9,10. Each OR is composed of two functionally essential parts: a highly conserved co-receptor subunit (Orco) and one of a large number of variable odorant-binding (or “tuning”) subunits11–17. These subunits associate in an unknown stoichiometry to form an odorant-gated ion channel18,19. ORs have also been proposed to initiate, or be modified by, second messenger cascades13,18. While the odorant-binding subunit is responsible for interacting with odorants9,20,21, both the odorant-binding subunits and Orco are involved in forming the ion channel pore21,22. Insect ORs are not related to the receptors and channels of humans and other tetrapods15, suggesting that control of detrimental insect activity may be possible through the development of insect OR selective compounds. A current approach to developing these compounds is to identify the particular odorant binding subunits that recognize behaviorally important odorants10,23–26 and then conduct large scale ligand screens27,28, but high diversity among the odorant binding subunit repertoires of different species makes this approach exceptionally labor intensive29,30.The recent identification of the synthetic compound VUAA1 as a novel OR agonist that acts directly on Orco27, suggests that manipulation of insect behavior might be achieved by targeting Orco. Based on the VUAA1 structure, several additional synthetic Orco agonists and a larger, more diverse series of synthetic Orco antagonists have been identified31–33. Importantly, several of these Orco antagonists were shown to inhibit odorant activation of ORs through a non-competitive mechanism31–33. These findings suggest that Orco antagonists might be useful in altering insect behavior.Orco subunits are highly conserved across insect species, suggesting that Orco serves an essential function common to all insect ORs15,34. This high conservation underlies observations that Orco subunits from different species are functionally interchangeable; an Orco subunit from one species can form functional ORs with an odorant-binding subunit from a different species21,22. As the “pharmacology” of synthetic Orco agonists and antagonists has expanded, it has also become clear that Orco subunits from disparate insect species have very similar sensitivities to known Orco ligands27,31–33,35. This suggested to us that the binding site for Orco ligands may serve as a modulatory site for compounds endogenous to the insects or may be a target of exogenous compounds, such as those generated by plants. Insects use a variety of amines as neurotransmitters and neuromodulators36–39. Plants also generate a variety of amines that may play a role in resistance to insect herbivores40–42. For these reasons, we screened a panel of biogenic and trace amines for agonist and antagonist activity at insect Orco subunits. We found tryptamine to be a potent Orco antagonist with broad activity at Orco subunits from different species. Tyramine and phenethylamine also function as Orco antagonists, but were substantially less potent than tryptamine. Importantly, we found that tryptamine, acting through Orco, could inhibit odorant activation of a wide range of ORs from a variety of insect species. Our findings suggest a role for Orco as a modulatory site common to all insect ORs and support the development of Orco-directed compounds that can be used to manipulate insect behavior.","06 May 2014","Approved","Coral Warr, School of Biological Sciences, Monash University, Australia",NA," In this study the authors report the identification of new antagonists for the Orco protein, a co-receptor for the ligand binding Olfactory receptor (Or) family in insects. This is of interest as they suggest Orco antagonists might be a useful approach to modifying insect behaviour. The authors screened a panel of biogenic amines and found several that functioned as Orco antagonists, of which tryptamine, naturally produced in plants, was the most effective. They further showed that this activity was conserved against Orco from a number of insect species. The paper is well written, the data is solid and well presented, and is appropriately analysed and interpreted. The caveat to the use of currently identified Orco antagonists in biocontrol, namely that they appear to affect Orco in all insects and are not species-specific, is appropriately acknowledged. My one feedback comment is that the justification for screening just amines was not really clear, and I wondered if the authors had also in fact screened other types of compounds? If so it would be valuable to other researchers to also mention any screened compounds that did not have any effect on Orco function.    I have read this submission.

This in turn results in repression of translation through phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2a6. Although the biochemical function of PACT as an activator of PKR is well established, the physiological role of this protein in vivo is unclear. Indeed, generation of mice lacking RAX revealed a role for this protein in craniofacial7,8 and anterior pituitary development9 that is not readily explained by current knowledge of its biochemical function. More recently, PACT has been identified as a component of the RNA silencing (siRNA/miRNA) pathway10,11, although a detailed understanding of its role in this pathway is limited. Thus, PACT functions in two independent pathways that govern post-transcriptional gene regulation and as such it is important to understand the overall physiological function of this protein. To this end, we investigated the functional orthology between PACT and the Drosophila melanogaster dsRBP R2D2.RNA silencing through the micro-RNA (miRNA) and short-interfering RNA (siRNA) pathways regulates nearly every aspect of cellular biology (reviewed by van Kouwenhove et al.12,13). Both siRNA and miRNA pathways require cytoplasmic processing of precursor molecules (either dsRNA or ~70bp pre-miRNAs) to generate mature guide RNAs (reviewed by van Kouwenhove et al.12). In both cases, this cytoplasmic processing step is accomplished by the endonuclease Dicer in complex with one or more dsRNA binding proteins, which cleaves precursor RNA molecules into ~20–25bp dsRNA. One of the two strands of the Dicer-processed mature RNA molecule (known as the guide strand) is then loaded into the effector complex, the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) (reviewed by Czech and Hannon13). Although the precise composition of the RISC is unclear, various studies have demonstrated the presence of a mature guide RNA, Dicer, one or more accessory dsRBPs, and one of the four members of the Argonaute protein family (Ago1–4) which function as the effector enzymes in the terminal silencing step14.The RNA silencing pathways of metazoans have largely been investigated in the model organisms Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. In both systems, it was discovered that the endonucleases required for cleavage of pri-miRNAs (Drosha) and pre-miRNAs/siRNA precursors (Dicer) form complexes with specific dsRBPs. These proteins, like PACT, are comprised of tandem dsRBDs with no other identifiable domains (Drosha complexes with Pasha/DGCR815, C. elegans Dicer binds RDE-416, D. melanogaster Dicer-1 binds Loquacious (LOQS)17 and D. melanogaster Dicer-2 binds R2D218). Furthermore, these dsRBPs are required for the processing functions of the complexes. In mammalian systems, processing of both siRNA and miRNA is performed by a common Dicer enzyme. Both PACT and a similar dsRBP Tat Trans-activation element RNA binding protein (TRBP) in human/Protamine-1 RNA binding protein (PRBP) in mouse have been demonstrated to bind Dicer through either their N-terminal dsRNA binding motifs or their C-terminal Merlin-Dicer-PACT Liaison (Medipal) domain (which contains the PKR activation domain of PACT)10,11,19. The binding of PACT, TRBP or both with Dicer enhances the ability of Dicer to process dsRNA into siRNAs in vitro10. These findings suggest a functional significance to the PACT/TRBP/Dicer interactions, although the mechanism by which this occurs is unclear. These reports suggest that in addition to the regulating PKR activation, PACT may affect post-transcriptional control via small RNA pathways.In Drosophila, processing of small RNA precursors is accomplished by separate enzymes, Dicer-1 for miRNA and Dicer-2 for siRNA20. The dsRNA binding proteins LOQS17 and R2D218 bind to Dicer-1 and Dicer-2, respectively. LOQS and R2D2 sort precursor RNA molecules based on the presence or absence of mismatches in the stemloop of the hairpin or dsRNA precursor to the appropriate Dicer processing pathway23 and facilitate RISC loading24,25. LOQS encodes four isoforms; LOQS-PA and LOQS-PB contain three tandem dsRBDs whereas both LOQS-PC and LOQS-PD21,22 lack the third C-terminal dsRBD. R2D2 encodes a single isoform that is comprised of two dsRBDs18 (Figure 1). Within the dsRBDs of these proteins, there is a high degree of sequence similarity (71–78% similarity, see Table 1) between PACT and LOQS PA and PB (which have all three dsRBDs in common). This sequence similarity coupled with the tandem dsRBD architecture (see Figure 1 and Table 1) indicates potential functional orthology between PACT and LOQS. Although R2D2 is significantly less similar to PACT (46% sequence similarity within dsRBD2, with no detectable similarity within dsRBD1), it has nonetheless been demonstrated to bind Dicer-218 and possesses a tandem dsRBD architecture similar to PACT and LOQS and thus may also function orthologously to PACT/RAX.Table 1.

Dashed lines designate dsRBD1, 2 or 3.Previous studies have produced mutant D. melanogaster lines lacking either of the dsRBPs that interact with Dicer-1 and Dicer-2. Flies deficient in all four isoforms of LOQS display developmental lethality, and do not survive past the pupal stage26. In contrast, flies homozygous mutant for a null allele of r2d2 are semi-lethal but the surviving flies have severe fertility defects27. The fertility phenotype results from defective oogenesis. Specifically, loss of R2D2 disrupts formation of the stalk cells, which normally separate individual follicles from each other28. This phenotype is enhanced by a dicer-1 mutant, indicating an unexpected interaction between R2D2 and Dicer-1 rather than Dicer-227.We hypothesized that one or more dsRNA binding proteins with known function in D. melanogaster are functionally orthologous to PACT, and that identification of the functional ortholog(s) would provide insight into the small RNA processing function of PACT. We sought to identify proteins orthologous to PACT by transgenically expressing human PACT in the well-characterized Drosophila genetic model system. We report here our efforts to determine the degree to which human PACT is a functional ortholog of Drosophila R2D2.","09 May 2014","Approved","Anthony Sadler, Monash Institute for Medical Research, Monash University, Australia","Author Response 03 Apr 2014"," I have read this submission.

Today, the primary reservoir for rabies in Georgia, and, in fact, the entire eastern part of the USA, is the raccoon (Procyon lotor). Although dogs previously served as the main reservoir for rabies throughout the USA, dog rabies virus variants in the USA have been eliminated through persistent vaccination programs and policies1. Rabies virus has evolved to adapt to a wildlife meso-carnivore in a population that can be defined by geographical regions where transmission is sustained (Figure 1)2. Over the second half of the last century, the eastern raccoon rabies variant has spread northward and, in Georgia, the raccoon rabies enzootic has been established for over 50 years3.Figure 1. Reservoir species for rabies across the USA.Infection from the reservoir species to another mammalian host can, and still does occur, but the non-reservoir animal most likely becomes a dead-end host4. Cases of rabies in Georgia in non-reservoir wildlife, such as foxes, coyotes and skunks, and in domesticated animals, such as dogs, cats, and farm animals, can almost always be traced either to the raccoon variant, or to one of the circulating variants among several bat species, through DNA molecular typing5. Using Georgia Department of Public Health laboratory data on raccoon specimens submitted for rabies testing, and the US Geological Survey Land Cover Database, we report a model to predict rabid raccoon cases from land use patterns.Raccoon rabies epidemiologyIt is well documented that higher densities of raccoon populations exist in urbanized areas than in more natural habitats, and, that the highest densities are found at the urban-rural interface6–9. An opportunistic omnivore, eating anything from crayfish in creeks to acorns, bird eggs, garden vegetables and even garbage, raccoons have been essentially subsidized by urbanization by the creation of an edge ecosystem. An edge ecosystem is created when habitat is broken up. This can occur naturally, such as disturbance by fire, or can be part of the geomorphology, such as the demarcation between uplands and wetlands. Or it can occur when development creates a new transition between forest and open space. Although some of the open space is replaced with impervious surfaces, i.e. roads and rooftops, higher raccoon populations can be sustained because they have increased access to food resources, and fewer predators, while still using the adjacent natural habitat for protective cover10.This raccoon ecological theory, and the way it relates to land use patterns, has been supported in numerous studies where raccoon rabies epidemics occur during the initial introduction of rabies into naïve raccoon populations. These studies have described “sensational” epizootics so fulminating that natural barriers such as rivers can only slow them down11,12. Once the infection becomes enzootic in a raccoon population, large outbreaks rarely occur and the disease becomes incessant (Figure 2)13.Figure 2. Schematic of the temporal stages of a typical county in New York during the raccoon rabies epizootic from 1992 to 2000.Stage a: Pre-raccoon variant – rare cases in raccoons; cases of raccoon rabies might spill over from other wildlife. b1: initial epizootic of raccoon variant rabies as it moves through the county. c1: sequential epizootic. d1: sequential inter-epizootics. (Adapted from Gordon et al., 200413).Mitigating the passive public health databaseThe number of raccoons submitted for rabies testing listed by county and month was acquired from the Georgia Department of Public Health for a five-year period from 2006 to 2010. This database only represents results from raccoons involved in human or domestic animal exposure incidents that are submitted to the Georgia Public Health Laboratories (GPHL). Testing is done solely to inform medical professionals how to proceed with rabies prophylaxis for potential human exposure cases. The presence of rabies virus in the raccoon specimens is tested by direct fluorescent-antibody staining of brain tissue. [http://www.cdc.gov/rabies/diagnosis/direct_fluorescent_antibody.html].The mosaic of urban and suburban development poses challenges to this type of surveillance of the raccoon rabies reservoir because higher human population densities bias reporting to passive public health surveillance systems (Figure 3); detection of positive cases in developed areas is likely increased due to the probability of more human-raccoon and domestic animal-raccoon interactions14. Due to potential confidentiality issues concerning the person exposed, this data is aggregated and reported at the county level. The number of raccoons submitted for testing closely parallels the human population densities.Figure 3. The population densities of 159 Georgia counties by quartile from the 2010 census as compared to the number of raccoons submitted per county for rabies testing by quartile from 2006–2010.Prior to 2006, only positive cases were reported by GPHL. Because the 2006–2010 GPHL dataset reported both positive and negative submissions, there was opportunity to possibly mitigate the surveillance bias to some extent by incorporating a standardizing variable. The Getis-Ord Gi statistical tool in GIS (ESRI ArcMap 10) was used to exhibit spatial clustering of counties with higher or lower than expected number of positive cases, positive cases per person per square kilometer, and the number of submissions per person per square kilometer (Figure 4)15.Figure 4. Significant clustering of positive cases occurs mostly in the metro Atlanta area where there are also high submission rates.The clustering of positive cases is mostly away from major population centers when analyzed as a rate of population density. Clustering of submissions/density closely parallels positive cases/density.When the number of positive cases is put at a rate of population density, the clustering disperses away from the metropolitan areas. However, because our model counted the number of positive cases as the outcome variable, we wanted to use some form of the submissions data as the “weighted” standardizing variable on the right side of the regression model to normalize counties. Table 1 summarizes the human demographic and GPHL testing data. There were forty-six counties that were inclusive in the upper quartile for positive cases. Forty counties were inclusive in the upper quartile for the number of submissions for testing, as well as all other independent land use variables. The high odds ratio for both submissions, and population density, confirms that as there is more testing, there are more positive cases; it is a matter of more intense surveillance, and does not necessarily reflect the pattern of the rabies reservoir in the raccoon. However, when density is used as the denominator to analyze the effect of rate of submissions on disease predictability, the odds ratio falls (3.1). The drop in the odds ratio, though still significant, could reflect two possibilities: that there truly are higher raccoon densities in more populated areas and/or that the database bias has been mitigated to some extent.Table 1. Human demographic data, number of submissions for testing, and positive raccoon cases from 2006–2010 for 159 Georgia counties.Sub/density is the weighted variable used in the regression model.

These three development variables are determined from measuring the impervious surface, and constitute less than 50% (combining “open space” and “low intensity”), 50 – 79% (“medium intensity”), and 80% or greater impervious surface area (“high intensity”), respectively. The agricultural variable was also constructed on the method of Jones et al. 2003, and is a combination of pasture/hay and cultivated crops. Both, demographic data, and land area of each county, were obtained from the 2010 US Census [http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/13000.html].There were 1011 rabid raccoons from a total of 2064 raccoon specimens submitted from 150 counties over the five year period. A univariate analysis was conducted for all variables, including land-use data, human population density, and the number of rabid raccoons (outcome variable), by dichotomizing at the upper quartile to determine crude odds ratios (OR).Urbanization variables (“Low intensity res”, “High intensity res”, and “Com/Ind/Trans”) had the highest crude odds ratios among all the land use variables examined (Table 2).

Duplication, triplication or mutations in the a-synuclein gene cause some forms of familial PD3,4. However, the mechanism whereby a-synuclein promotes neurodegeneration remains unclear.Dyneins are minus end-directed microtubule motors that move cargoes such as mitochondria, organelles and proteins from the distal ends of axons toward neuronal cell bodies5,6. Dynein is the major motor of retrograde axonal transport, and it is also the molecular motor responsible for the transport of misfolded proteins to be degraded. Therefore, it is crucially involved in the appearance and clearance of protein aggregates7. Several studies have supported the involvement of dynein in the neurodegeneration associated with PD. First, recent studies suggest that axonal transport disruption may be causal to disease progression in PD8,9. Alterations in axonal transport motor proteins have been observed in postmortem patient brain samples9 and treatment with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), a PD-relevant injury, leads to defective axonal transport, including increased dynein-dependent transport10. Second, a number of dynein-dependent processes, including autophagy or clearance of aggregation-prone proteins, are found to be defective in PD11. In all cases, defects in axonal transport and autophagy occurring in PD indicate that dynein may be a central factor in PD pathology. Interestingly, experimental evidence suggests that a-synuclein mutations (A53T, A30P) might lead to axonal transport defects both in vivo and in vitro8,9,12. Therefore, we hypothesized that the neurodegeneration observed in the A53T mutant human a-synuclein transgenic (Tg) mouse model of a-synucleinopathy was associated with alterations of dynein.In this study, we first evaluated the motor function of A53T human a-synuclein Tg mice and age-matched non-transgenic (nTg) littermates using a modified open field test. Unlike previous studies that only provided behavioral descriptions, in this study, we quantified behavior. We then examined the expression of dynein in the striatum and substantia nigra (SN), as dynein defects have been mostly studied in the nigrostriatal system in previous research9. To evaluate whether changes of dynein were related to a-synuclein aggregation, double immunostaining for a-synuclein and dynein was performed. In addition, we analyzed the correlation between the motor behaviors and the protein level of dynein in the striatum. Our findings reveal that dynein changes in the nigrostriatal system of A53T a-synuclein Tg mice may contribute to their dramatic motor phenotype.","28 Jul 2014","Approved with Reservations","Abraham Acevedo-Arozena, Medical Research Council (MRC) Mammalian Genetics Unit, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus, UK",NA," Defects in axonal transport are associated with a number of neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson’s disease (PD). Retrograde transport in neurons is powered by the cytoplasmic dynein complex, a macromolecular structure that contains different heavy, intermediate and light dynein polypeptides.  Here, Liu et al report changes in “dynein” protein levels in a widely used mouse model of PD over-expressing mutant (A53T) a-synuclein. Interestingly, the authors found an increase in a-synuclein levels via immunoblot and immunohistochemistry in the substantia nigra (SN) of symptomatic a-synuclein mutant transgenic mice. Conversely, they found a decrease in “dynein” from the striatum of the same mice. The authors used an interesting modification of the open field paradigm to test the mice for motor abnormalities. By comparing the levels of “dynein” in the striatum with the degree of motor deficits in the tested mice, the authors found a correlation between striatum dynein levels and motor performance.Comments:Although the authors refer to “dynein” levels throughout the manuscript, the antibodies they are using for immunoblot are against the cytoplasmic intermediate chain (DIC1?). This needs to be clarified in the materials and also throughout the manuscript. The same applies to the immunohistochemistry. The authors report using two different anti-“dynein” antibodies, but one is against DIC (as above) and the other one against a cytoplasmic dynein light chain (DYNLT3). The authors should clarify which antibody they are using in Figure 3, as well as clarify throughout the text which cytoplasmic dynein subunits they are referring to.   The authors state at the end of the discussion that “although dynein defects occur in the SN, TH expressing neurons of the SN are spared from pathology”. However, they do not show TH co-staining together with a-synuclein in Figure 3. If this statement is referring to previously published data, it should be referenced. If it is referring to their data, it should also appear in Figure 3. In Figure 4, it appears that non-transgenic mice have also been used, together with symptomatic A53T transgenics, for the correlation between the “dynein” levels and the motor abnormalities. I would like to see the same correlation using transgenic mice only, which have obvious motor abnormalities. I have read this submission.

Cerebral ischaemia, caused by the reduction of blood flow in a cerebral artery, is the most common type of stroke, accounting for 80% of strokes1. Cellular therapy is an emerging and promising avenue for treatment of cerebral ischaemia. Several experimental studies have demonstrated that treatment with neural stem cells after an ischaemic event improves neurological score and behavioural recovery, and can reduce infarct volume2–5. These findings have led to a small number of clinical trials of cellular therapy in stroke patients, with modest effects on neurological outcome and motor skill recovery6–9. It is clear that further optimisation of cell type and cell delivery, and a greater understanding of the behaviour of engrafted cells in vivo is required for improved therapeutic outcome.Previous research has demonstrated that fetal telencephalic neural progenitor cells engrafted into the ischaemic brain are capable of migration towards the infarct, and of improving behavioural recovery10. A small percentage of engrafted neural stem/progenitor cells (NPCs) have been shown to differentiate into neurons in the peri-infarct area and integrate into the neural network11–18. Developmentally, NPCs give rise to the cortical neuron layers in the normal developing embryo, and may have the appropriate migratory capacity and neurogenic potential to give rise to neurons after engraftment into host injury tissue. In vivo monitoring of engrafted cells is an important tool that could be developed to correlate cell behaviour and distribution with clinical outcome. Cellular imaging with MRI contrast agents can be used to monitor the distribution of transplanted cells in models of cerebral ischaemia. Hoehn et al. demonstrated that mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells could be labelled with an iron oxide-based agent19 and subsequently migrate into the infarcted area from the contralateral hemisphere. Cell migration and functional improvement has been observed in rat models of stroke after intracisternal injection of superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO)-labelled neurospheres20. Engrafted cells labelled with SPIO have been shown to survive and differentiate into neural lineages in the ischaemic striatum21.Further development of contrast agents with low toxicity, high labelling efficiency and retention is required for improved detectability and effective long-term cell tracking in vivo.The ferumoxide Endorem is a dextran-coated superparamagnetic iron oxide agent that can form a complex with the polycationic protamine sulphate – the FePro complex22–24. Previous studies have suggested that the FePro complex has little effect on cell viability and behaviour23–25.Therefore we wished to assess the effect of FePro on NPC behaviour, and establish whether labelling and in vivo imaging of NPCs could be enhanced by using this complex. We studied the effect of FePro labelling on NPC metabolism, proliferation and differentiation capacity. FePro-labelled NPCs were engrafted into the ipsilateral parenchyma at 48 hours post-ischaemia and monitored over 4 weeks using MRI. Assessment of NPC proliferation and differentiation capacity demonstrated no difference in the behaviour of FePro-labelled NPC compared to unlabelled NPC. In vivo, we observed the evolution of hypointense T2 contrast in the ischaemic striatum over several weeks in both control and FePro-NPC engrafted animals.","21 Jan 2014","Approved","Keith Muir, Institute of Neuroscience and Psychology, University of Glasgow, UK","Author Response (F1000Research Advisory Board Member) 19 Dec 2013"," This study highlights difficulties with the use of MRI contrast agents for the imaging of cells in vivo in stroke models.The evolution of ischaemic damage after stroke typically involves a degree of petechial haemorrhage with deposition of haemosiderin commonly evident histologically or on sensitive MRI sequences after an iscaemic event. Confounding of the signal from iron-labelled cell therapies is therefore likely, as described here.In vitro functional assays offer some evidence that the MRI contrast agent may not affect important properties of the NPC cell line, but the in vivo assessment is incomplete and deserves comment. Effects on infarct volume are highly unlikely with therapies delivered 48h after ischaemia, so this is unsurprising and neither supports nor argues against a therapeutic effect. Functional assays are more difficult and time consuming, but a rodent focal ischaemia model with delayed cell delivery would offer the only means of establishing whether any therapeutic effect is compromised by the cell label. This would be important for further study since it has previously been reported that intracellular MRI labels (a gadolinium conjugate) negated functional benefits from a neural stem cell line (Modo et al. Neuroimage. 2009;47 Suppl 2:T133-42). I have read this submission. I believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard.

The eastward range expansion was likely facilitated by widespread deforestation associated with agricultural development in the early 20th century and by the near extirpation of eastern wolves (Canis lupus lycaon or Canis lycaon) and red wolves (Canis rufus)3–5. The range expansion into northeastern North America advanced as two primary colonization fronts: the northern route through Ontario, where coyotes hybridized with resident eastern wolves, and the southern route through Ohio, where wolves were eradicated prior to coyote expansion2,5,6. Along with its geographic range expansion, the coyote also experienced a niche expansion by rapidly colonizing whole new biomes, including eastern temperate and boreal forests1. This complex scenario of colonization provides an interesting opportunity to explore the swift formation of population genetic structure following a rapid expansion in geographic distribution and ecological niche.Recent analyses of population structure in northeastern coyotes have described a general lack of genetic differentiation among sampling localities, except at the coarsest geographic scales. Way et al.7 examined genetic variation and structure in a sample of coyotes from eastern Massachusetts using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and eight microsatellite loci. They found no genetic structure in coyotes within Massachusetts or even within the broader region of northeastern North America. Instead, northeastern coyotes seemed to constitute one uniform population slightly differentiated from western coyotes. In another analysis of genetic variation in northeastern coyotes, Kays et al.5 identified three coarse phylogeographic areas: Ohio, the northeast zone, and a contact zone in western Pennsylvania and New York where the colonization front from Ohio has spread into the northeastern population. Although Kays et al. surveyed genetic variation in a dense geographic sample of 687 coyotes, they only used one genetic marker, the hypervariable mtDNA control region. vonHoldt et al.8 conducted a genome-wide analysis of North American Canis species and detected population structure in C. latrans, but only at the broadest continental scale. Although vonHoldt et al. genotyped tens of thousands of loci, they only sampled 14 northeastern coyotes, making detection of finer levels of population structure in the region very improbable. Thus, all the previous studies of population structure in northeastern coyotes have adopted one of two strategies: sampling many individuals using one (mtDNA) or very few molecular markers, or sampling very few individuals using thousands of genomic markers. A regional analysis of genetic diversity and population structure in northeastern coyotes using many samples and many nuclear molecular markers is currently lacking.Genetic structure is a ubiquitous property of natural, domesticated, and human populations. Population genetic structure plays considerable roles in evolution, as both the basis and the consequence of local adaptation, the splitting of one species into two if the environments are markedly different, and the adaptability of a species as a whole across its range (i.e., transformation rather than speciation)9. The detection of genetic structure largely depends on the type and number of molecular markers examined, their variability in the target population, the number of individuals sampled, and the spatial sampling scheme10,11. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have become a popular and inexpensive tool in the field of molecular population genetics. SNPs have properties that make them a superior alternative to other widely used genetic markers, such as microsatellites and mtDNA sequences, in evaluating genetic diversity and population structure12–14. Furthermore, the sampling scheme can greatly influence the location and composition of genetic clusters, especially in species that are continuously distributed across a landscape11, as are northeastern coyotes. Thus the conclusion of no population structure from previous analyses based on limited individual or genomic sampling may be imprecise.The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that fine-scale population structure in northeastern coyotes exists, but remains undetected due to the small number of individuals or the low resolution of the genetic markers previously analyzed. I hypothesized that population structure would be detectable, at finer levels than in previous analyses, by using an array of 16 high-heterozygosity nuclear SNPs ascertained from the dog genome and a spatially dense sample of 385 coyotes. This is the first comprehensive regional survey of genetic diversity and population structure in northeastern coyotes that uses a dense geographic sampling scheme and several SNPs. This regional analysis reveals a cryptic population structure and a geographic pattern of nuclear genetic diversity that is discrepant with previous mtDNA- and microsatellite-based surveys. More generally, this study adds to the growing body of recent literature that demonstrates the utility of SNPs discovered in a model organism for evolutionary inference in wild relatives, as long as ascertainment bias is explicitly evaluated.","30 May 2014","Approved","Mark Weckel, Center for Biodiversity & Conservation, American Museum of Natural History, USA",NA," First, thank you for the opportunity to review Javier Monzón’s article, “First regional evaluation of nuclear genetic diversity and population structure in northeastern coyotes (Canis latrans).”I found this to be a well-written, engaging, and thoughtful manuscript with important contributions to the use of SNPs in studies of population structure and in elucidating the genetic structure of the northeastern coyote. The author adeptly targets a need for using multiple markers across multiple individuals for proper inference. The author furthermore supports the use of the canine SNP array in studies of coyotes, following the recommendation of vonHoldt et al. (2011), while also asserting the need for addressing ascertainment bias prior to the use of SNPs in non-model organisms.I have no major reservations, rather a few minor comments regarding clarification of the methods along with some questions and considerations for future discussion and research.Methods:With such a large sample of high quality tissue available for the analysis, why were scats (n=6) included in the analysis? Were the scats important for adequate sampling across the study area? Fourteen of vonHoldt et al’s. (2011) coyote specimens were included in the initial selection of the 16 SNP panel used in subsequent analyses. Why were only 7 of vonHoldt et al.’s (2011) samples included in the analysis of diversity and structure? Results:Using the SNP panel, the author reports the observed and expected heterozygosity for the three putative population zones identified by Kays et al. (2010; Table 2). It would be interesting to see the Ho and He for the population clusters identify by the current STRUCTURE analysis (i.e., K =2 & K=3). What are the pairwise Fst values for two genetic clusters also supported by the STRUCTURE analysis? Discussion:There is ample evidence of genetic structure; however, I’m not sure that I would agree with the author’s suggestion that there is “some geographic structuring,” at least based on Figure 2c. The author does a thorough job of listing the factors and processes that may be involved in explaining a lack of geographic structure, as well as the discrepancy between the current nuclear analysis of population structure and the previous mtDNA analysis (Kays et al. 2010). A possible further explanation for the lack of geographic structuring could be that a SNP panel - with such high heterozygosity - may actually reflect older mutations that have had a longer time to move around the landscape via dispersal (see Morin et al. 2004).

However traditional protein-based body fluid identification methods use a variety of labor intensive and technologically diverse techniques that do not permit the identification of all body fluids and tissues. Thus there remains a need to develop definitive molecular based strategies for the conclusive identification of all forensically relevant biological fluids and tissues. Although protein1–3, epigenetic DNA markers4–10 and microRNAs11–17 are promising examples of such a molecular based approach, messenger RNA (mRNA) profiling represents the current gold standard in this area due to the identification and development of a number of specific and sensitive mRNA assays for the identification of all of the forensically-relevant body fluids and tissues, namely blood, semen, saliva, vaginal secretions, menstrual blood and skin13,18–36. Importantly, messenger RNA markers are surprisingly stable in the dried state in that they can be successfully detected in environmentally impacted and partially degraded samples20,22,25,26,37–40.Current mRNA body fluid identification assays typically involve capillary electrophoresis (CE) or quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) platforms13,20,24,28,29,31,32,34,35, each with its own limitations. Both platforms require the use of expensive fluorescently labeled primers or probes. CE-based assays require separate amplification and detection steps thus increasing the time required for analysis. For qRT-PCR assays, only 3 or 4 markers can be included in a single reaction since each marker requires a different fluorescent dye.In an attempt to simplify mRNA profiling assays, and to reduce the time and cost of analysis, we have investigated alternative technology solutions for mRNA profiling, particularly High Resolution Melt analysis (HRM). HRM is a rapid and relatively cheap bio-analytical method that was initially developed for sequence variant screening (i.e. mutation analysis) but which has also found utility in single nuclear polymorphism (SNP) typing41–44, methylation analysis45,46, copy number variant confirmation47–49, clone characterization50 and as an alternative for gel electrophoresis51. As its name suggests, HRM is a technique that permits the identification of specific PCR products (i.e. amplicons) by their melting temperature (Tm). An amplicon’s precise melting temperature is dependent on its sequence, length and the ionic strength of its environment and can be measured post-PCR to within 0.1°C with specialized software and hardware. HRM assays require only the use of unlabeled PCR primers and a single saturating intercalating fluorescent dye (e.g. Eva Green). The latter provides enhanced sensitivity by ensuring that all available double stranded DNA binding sites are saturated during the melting process. After amplification the amplicon is melted slowly by increasing the temperature and a loss of fluorescence occurs as the DNA strands separate and release the bound saturating dye into solution. By measuring the negative first derivative of fluorescence (F) with respect to temperature (T) (-dF/dT) a distinct and characteristic melt curve is obtained with the peak maximum representing the Tm. Importantly, due to the high resolution nature of the amplicon melt analysis, it is possible to perform multiplex analysis of several amplicons in one tube52.Here we describe the development and initial performance evaluation of singleplex and multiplex RNA-based HRM assays for the identification of the commonly encountered forensically relevant body fluids and tissues.","28 Jul 2014","Approved","Gustavo Gutierrez Gonzalez, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium","Author Response 24 Feb 2014"," The authors have satisfactorily addressed all concerns/comments we have initially raised.

Thus, besides good specificity, sensitivity and the ability to handle (unequal) mixtures are important performance characteristics for RNA assays.

Both body fluids were correctly identified in each of these mixtures. Successful detection of both components of a saliva-vaginal admixed sample was also observed for the hexaplex assay.

Similar to the experience of the referee with CE based assays, It is likely that some mixture types will be challenging to define because of the particular mixture composition or because one or more of the components are present as a minor fraction. In our experience with CE as well, highly abundant biomarkers tend to dominate detection and can mask the presence of a minor component. It will be interesting to see with future studies whether the use of the HRM assays will permit an improved detection of minor component fluids or tissues.

The sensitivity of each of the duplex assays was evaluated by testing a range of input total RNA, from 15pg to 100ng (15pg, 25pg, 50pg, 100pg, 250pg, 500pg. 1mg, 5ng, 10ng, 25ng, 50ng and 100ng). For the blood/menstrual blood duplex assay, both biomarkers (ALAS2 and MMP10) were detected using picogram quantities of input total RNA (consistently detected using 250 pg or more; variable below 250pg (positive results for both biomarkers with 15 and 50pg input, but not 25 and 100pg)). For the saliva/semen assay, both biomarkers (HTN3 and TGM4) were detected using as little as 25pg input. Using 15pg input, HTN3 was also detected but not TGM4. Therefore the sensitivities of these two duplex assays appear to be highly sensitive, requiring only picogram levels of input total RNA. Additionally, it should be noted that the total RNA input amounts listed represent the amount used in the RT reaction. Detection of product in the real time assays is performed with 1/10th of the RT input amount (2ml cDNA/20ml reaction). For the vaginal secretions/skin duplex assay, 5ng of input RNA (still only 500pg for detection) was required for IL19. Skin was successfully detected with as little as 100pg total RNA RT input. Since only one donor was tested for this initial sensitivity work, the actual sensitivity limits need to be determined with additional testing. For vaginal secretions, since no human specific RNA quantitation method is currently available, there is always a potential for the obtained RNA quantitation value to be artificially higher due to the presence of endogenous bacteria. Therefore, the total RNA input used for these samples may not be fully accurate which will then affect the sensitivity results. But overall, these assays appear to require picogram levels of input total RNA, which would make them suitable for use with forensic, samples.An initial sensitivity check for the hexaplex assay was also performed (again only one donor per fluid; 5 pg to 25 ng range of total RNA input into the RT reaction). The body fluids were detected down to varying lower input limits: blood (ALAS2) - 25 pg; menstrual blood (MMP10) - 250 pg; skin (CCL27) - 1ng; semen - 5ng; vaginal secretions – consistently with 1 ng or more input (variable detection in the 5pg to 1ng range); saliva (HTN3) – not determined at this time.While we performed this preliminary sensitivity evaluation, it was not included in the manuscript since only one donor was evaluated. More comprehensive sensitivity studies, particularly for the hexaplex system, will be included in a future publication describing a comprehensive testing and evaluation of the HRM assay.

For instance, in rabbit eyeblink conditioning, when ion channels related to after hyperpolarization are being suppressed by a learning event, they can become permanently suppressed. This has been shown for pyramidal cells of hippocampal areas CA1 and CA3, and for cerebellar Purkinje cells4,5. In some cases, these changes are permanent and still present after 30 days6,7, in other cases, intrinsic changes disappear after 3–7 days, while the behavioral memory remains intact, raising questions about the long-term component of intrinsic plasticity in these systems. There are at the present time conflicting ideas on the significance of IP compared to synaptic plasticity1,8, and the range of functions that IP may have in adaptivity9–12.A few computational models have been proposed that show how modification in activation functions can be achieved with ion channel based models of realistic single neurons. Marder and colleagues have developed an approach, where they sample a very large parameter space for conductances of ion channels, exploring nonlinearities in the relation between conductances and neural spiking behavior13–15. The motivation for this research are observations about neuromodulation and intrinsic plasticity in specific neurons of an invertebrate ganglion (e.g. LeMasson et al.,16). They have noted that large variations in some parameters may have little effect on neuronal behavior, while comparatively small variations in certain regions in parameter space may change response properties significantly. They also suggest that neuro modulation may provide an efficient means of targeting regions in parameter space with significant effects on response properties14.A study by Stemmler and Koch17 assumed the goal of modification of activation functions is to achieve an optimal distribution of firing rates for a population of neurons. The idea was that by tuning each neuron to a different band of the frequency spectrum, the full bandwidth of frequencies could be employed for information transfer. This goal was achieved by adjusting Na+, K+, and Ca++ channels for a generically defined neuron until a desired frequency was stably reached.We present a different approach, where the modification of activation functions reflects the history of exposure to stimuli for a specific neuron. In previous work18,19, it was suggested that synaptic LTP/LTD and linear regulations of intrinsic excitability could operate in a synergistic fashion. However, in our approach, different types of synaptic stimulation result in state changes for the neuronal unit, influencing its capacity for read-out of stored intrinsic properties. Different types of synaptic stimulation result in changes of neural transmission properties — synchronized input leading to a timed spike regime and distributed input leading to a ‘read-out’ of the intrinsic frequency or gain function. Thus, intrinsic plasticity, in contrast to synaptic plasticity, is only expressed or ‘read out’ under conditions of ongoing background stimulation, not in the presence of strong synchronous input. The learning rule that we derive as the basis for adjustment concerns one-dimensional upregulation or down-regulation of excitability in the “read-out” state of the neuron, and affecting only this state. This rule uses neural activation, significantly determined by intracellular calcium for the learning parameter, which can be shown to be biologically well-motivated (cf. also e.g. LeMasson et al.,16).","16 May 2014","Approved","Arvind Kumar, Neurobiology and Biophysics, University of Freiburg, Germany","Author Response 13 May 2014"," While the paper could have been improved by including one of the last suggestions I made in the earlier version, I think at this stage the manuscript is of adequate scientific quality.

Organo-fluorines have been widely used in pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, agrochemicals, and materials3,4, and it is estimated that 20–30% of commercial drugs, including many top-sellers, contain fluorine5. The increasing prevalence and success of organo-fluorines have instigated enormous efforts over the past decades in developing methodologies for efficiently introducing fluorine into organic molecules5,6, however the unique properties of fluorine make these chemical incorporations challenging, usually needing harsh synthetic conditions and giving rise to moderate chemo- or stereo- selectivity5,6.In contrast to chemical synthesis, biocatalytic synthesis or biosynthesis provide better efficacy and selectivity under mild conditions, and can be easily scaled up for industrial production7. Although natural fluorination is rare, efforts in identifying new bio-fluorination machineries are continuing. Pioneered by O’Hagan and co-workers, the natural bio-fluorination pathway to produce fluoroacetate (FAc) and 4-fluorothreonine (4-FT) was biochemically characterized in the actinomycete Streptomyces cattleya8. Enzymatic fluorination in S. cattleya occurs via a fluorine-fixation step that is catalyzed by the unique fluorinase enzyme FlA through the nucleophilic attack of fluoride to SAM9–11. The resulting fluoro-intermediate 5'-fluoro-5'-deoxyadenosine (5'-FDA) is further converted by five enzymes to give rise to the FAc and 4-FT (Figure 1A and B)8. This powerful bio-fluorination machinery has been proved very successful in incorporating both 18F and 19F into nucleotides12–16 and in producing the anticancer drug candidate fluorosalinosporamide17. Very recently, its enormous potential for producing complex fluorinated molecules was demonstrated by Chang and co-workers18. Using an engaging biosynthetic strategy they were able to achieve site-specific incorporation of FAc into the polyketide backbone of 2-desmethyltriketide lactone. Merging this strategy with the FAC producing pathway, such as the fl pathway in vivo, could present opportunities to use living cells for the production of acetate-derived fluorinated natural products that include polyketides, fatty acids, terpenoids and steroids.Figure 1.

(B) Proposed biosynthetic pathways to the FAc and 4-FT in the S. cattleya and N. brasiliensis.Synthetic biology approaches need pools of “genetic elements” to mix and match to build and optimize synthetic bio-pathways19. However, the only natural bio-fluorination tool available so far is the fl pathway. The limited natural bio-fluorination machinery forms the bottleneck for development of efficient synthetic bio-pathway to produce fluorinated natural products, thus an expansion of the genetic resources of biological fluorination is highly desired. Here, we report the identification of a latent fluorination pathway for FAc and 4-FT biosynthesis from the pathogen Nocardia brasiliensis ATCC 700358 and the biochemical characterization of a novel SAM-dependent fluorinase enzyme.","24 Mar 2014","Approved","Cormac Murphy, Center for Synthesis and Chemical Biology, University College Dublin, Ireland",NA," The paper confirms the very recent work of Deng et al.

Coral bleaching is a generalised stress response resulting from numerous causes including sedimentation, freshwater exposure or disease4; however, the most geographically extensive and severe events are correlated with sustained periods of elevated sea water temperatures and high light irradiance5. The bleaching response is caused by the expulsion of a symbiotic dinoflagellate Symbiodinium that occur within the coral tissue and allow corals to harness energy from sunlight, thus providing a significant portion of the energy requirements. The sensitivity of this symbiosis to elevated sea temperature is well-documented5,6, suggesting that many coral species will be highly vulnerable to the effects of global warming7,8.Despite this apparent sensitivity, reef corals have persisted through numerous large-magnitude and sometimes rapid changes in sea surface temperatures over the past 240 million years3,9. One mechanism by which a species can cope with changing local climate is to move to a more favourable area, and tropical reef corals have repeatedly shifted their distribution to higher latitudes in response to past climate warming10,11. Alternatively, populations may persist in microrefugia, defined as small areas of suitable habitat within regionally unfavourable environmental conditions12,13. Despite increasing recognition of their importance for conservation planning in terrestrial ecosystems14–16, microrefugia are less considered in the marine realm.The severity of coral bleaching is often spatially heterogeneous due to both historical17,18 and environmental19–21 factors. Coral bleaching is caused by a synergistic effect between heat and light, and therefore microrefugia from bleaching are likely to occur in regions where oceanographic or atmospheric conditions reduce water temperatures or light irradiance relative to surrounding areas22. Light irradiance declines with depth and ambient temperatures are often lower in deeper waters, therefore the incidence of bleaching and/or subsequent mortality is likely to be lower at greater water depths1,5,22. Warm-water coral bleaching is occasionally reported to depths of 50 m, however, such observations are rarely followed up in order to estimate bleaching-induced mortality. Typically the incidence of bleaching is substantially lower at greater depths and in the few cases it has been measured, so is bleaching-induced mortality23–25. For example, mortality rates of corals at a depth of 6 m were only a third of those in 2 m across several turbid inshore reefs on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR)24. A transition from high to low mortality with increasing depth was observed at numerous sites in the western Indian Ocean during 1998, the most severe and widespread bleaching event on record26. This transition often occurred across a fairly sharp depth boundary at intermediate depths of 10–15 m26, therefore species with depth ranges that straddle this transition from high to low bleaching mortality will have a refuge from bleaching in deeper water. However, most assessments of coral reefs consider only shallow habitats, and reductions in mortality with increasing depth may go unnoticed. Furthermore, recent studies of deep-water reefs have indicated that many corals may occur over a wider depth range than currently thought27,28.In May–June 2010, a sustained increase in seawater temperatures in the Andaman and South China Seas resulted in extensive coral bleaching and caused high mortality of many coral species29. Six weeks after the peak seawater temperatures, 45% of all corals and 94% of Acropora colonies were dead in shallow waters (1–2 m) around Pulau Weh, Sumatra, Indonesia29. Here, we assess the effects of this severe thermal bleaching event at Pulau Weh over a depth gradient from 2–27 m to investigate 1) whether severe mortality of reef corals observed in shallow water (0–2 m) extended into deeper habitats; and 2) whether depth provided a refuge from bleaching mortality. We concentrate on the corals of the genus Acropora because they are the most diverse and abundant genus in the Indo-Pacific, and are important ecosystem engineers on most Indo-Pacific coral reefs. They are also often amongst the most susceptible taxa to bleaching-induced mortality, and bleaching events often result in shifts from Acropora – dominated communities towards communities dominated by more bleaching resistant taxa (e.g. Porites and the family Merulinidae)26,30. Change in Acropora cover before and after a bleaching event is therefore a useful indicator of bleaching severity.","22 May 2014","Approved","Bert Hoeksema, Netherlands Centre for Biodiversity Naturalis, Netherlands","Author Response 21 Feb 2014"," I have read this submission.

The majority of heart development studies use model organisms for ethical and practical reasons. Transparent fish embryos, as well chick embryos, enable the developing heart to be studied in real time1, and the mouse continues to be a key model organism used to investigate mammalian heart development2. Although there is substantial evolutionary conservation in the development of left-right axis asymmetry, there is divergence between species3. The earliest events in mammalian heart development are of great interest, but are poorly understood relative to externally developing organs, due to practical constraints.For the majority of developing vertebrate embryos left-right asymmetry is controlled by a ciliated region; the left-right organizer node in the mouse and human, and the Kuppfer’s vesicle in the zebrafish4,5. In the zebrafish, laterality cues from the Kuppfer’s vesicle determine asymmetry in the developing heart, and consequently the direction of heart jogging and heart looping. At 24 hours post-fertilization (hpf) the symmetrical zebrafish heart tube is displaced relative to the dorsal midline, with a leftward ‘jog’. At 36hpf the heart tube then loops to the right to create the asymmetric heart5,6. Cilia within the Kuppfer’s vesicle are known to be instrumental in establishing left-right asymmetry and consequently play a significant role in determining the direction of heart jogging7 and heart looping8. However, a failure of heart jogging does not necessarily imply that there will be a failure in heart looping, and vice versa. In addition, asymmetric cell migration has been implicated as a key factor in the process of heart jogging9–13. Several of the genes involved in zebrafish heart jogging have been identified from mutation, morpholino and functional complementation studies6,10,13–26.We sought to determine whether the use of Gene Ontology (GO) annotation could offer mechanistic clues to early mammalian heart development. GO is a controlled vocabulary that is used to describe gene product function27. GO describes three aspects of a gene product’s biology: the biological process that the gene product is involved in, the specific molecular function of the gene product and the cellular component that the gene product is located in. GO terms are associated in a directed acyclic graph (DAG), and thus have defined relationships to each other.The process of heart looping has been described in a variety of higher eukaryotes2,28,29, and the occurrence of dextral-looping, the early phase of heart looping, appears to be conserved from zebrafish to chicken to humans. In addition, many congenital heart abnormalities, such as dextrocardia and isomerisms are thought to be due to abnormal heart looping2,30 and ciliary dysfunction has been associated with 50% of patients with congenital heart disease and heterotaxy31. However, the process of heart jogging has only been described in zebrafish6. Biben and Harvey describe a leftward shift of the developing mouse caudal heart prior to looping, which may be analogous to heart jogging in zebrafish28, but to our knowledge this has not been investigated further, and heart jogging is not considered to occur in mammals. Consequently, when the ontology describing heart development was expanded32, limitations were included to prevent the association of the GO term ‘heart jogging’ to mammalian gene products33. However, an absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, hence it remains a possibility that heart jogging also occurs in mammalian systems.Although there has been substantial progress in heart development research1,3,4,29, there are clearly gaps in our understanding of early heart development, particularly in the mammal. Functional enrichment analysis of genes known to be involved in zebrafish heart jogging, and also of the human and mouse orthologs of these zebrafish heart jogging genes, identifies many conserved biological processes, functions and cellular locations across these three species. The results of these analyses support the role of cilia in symmetry breaking and the importance of cell signalling in early heart development.","12 Feb 2014","Approved","Jeroen Bakkers, Cardiac Development and Genetics, Hubrecht Institute, Netherlands","Author Response 19 Feb 2014"," I have read this submission.

As a result, research tools and approaches that once required large consortia1–3, may now be used by small groups of collaborators or even independent labs. Although high throughput technology has been democratized, formidable impediments remain that prohibit researchers whose work is not in human, model human, or agriculturally important species from realizing its benefits. Specifically, sequence data, once produced, is mapped to a reference genome for the species of the subject under investigation. The 10ktrees4 project describes the phylogenetic relationship of 299 even-toed ungulates. Of these, only cattle, swine, sheep, goat, water buffalo, and bison have annotated reference genomes. For the other species a reference genome has not been built, and will likely not be built for another decade or more.The goal of this study is to investigate whether or not an even-toed ungulate could benefit from the reference genomes of the few member species that do have them. To test this, one lane of paired-end Illumina sequence data (~35 billion bases) for a Katahdin ram was generated and mapped to its ovine reference assembly Oarv3.15 and to the bovine reference assembly UMD3.16. The variants measured for the Katahdin ram vs. UMD3.1 demonstrate the wealth of information that can be derived from an interspecies mapping. The majority of these variants are homozygous, and for the most part represent species-specific differences. Any heterozygous variant plausibly represents an intraspecies variation present in sheep. Approximately 78 million homozygous, and 3.6 million heterozygous variants were identified for this ram in non-repeat regions of the cattle genome (which excluded the X chromosome; chrX). Mapping the same dataset to Oar3.1 corroborated more than 1.2 million of the heterozygous variants (>80% of what could be checked, see Table 1). This result suggests that high throughput sequence data for any of the distantly related even-toed ungulates may be mapped to the reference genomes of related species that have annotated references for variant discovery, comparative genetics, and even, perhaps genotype-phenotype association studies.Table 1.

This may be considerable, especially for keystone species, such as forest trees, which serve as food and habitat for numerous primary consumers. A vast number of studies have already shown that arthropod communities respond to genetic differences among individual plants within interspecific hybridizing complexes (e.g. Eucalyptus3, Salix4, Populus5, Quercus6) or specific genotypes within species (e.g. Oenothera biennis7, Eucalyptus globulus8, Solidago altissima9, Populus angustifolia10). However, it has recently been argued that the role of plant genetic variation in structuring arthropod communities has been considerably inflated due to the common methodological flaw that genotypes are collected from diverse and often distant environments, which maximizes genetic variation, whilst experiments are performed in a single common garden where environmental variation is minimized11,12. Indeed, when this mismatch in scale was avoided in the experimental design, spatial processes relegated host plant genotype to a secondary role in structuring insect communities of Quercus robur L.13. Whether this applies to all systems is, however, not yet known.Genes encounter a range of environments in nature and it has long been recognized that genetic determination of plant susceptibility to a herbivorous insect depends on environmental context14. However, most studies that have examined the role of genotype × environment interactions in the abundance and distribution of herbivorous species, have used only one or a few closely related herbivore species (e.g.15–18), and much fewer studies have examined genotype × environment interactions in a community context7,13,19,20. It is well recognized that we know too little of the relative importance of intraspecific genetic variation compared to other ecological factors that also influence multi-trophic communities and ecosystem processes11. Thus, the examination of genotype × environment interactions in a community context may be essential for improving our knowledge in the developing field of community genetics.Silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) is an ideal tree species in which to examine the mechanisms of plant-herbivore interactions and the community-level consequences of trait variation, because the species shows remarkable genetic variation in its resistance to herbivores21–24. In addition, the genetic variation of secondary metabolites26, nutrient concentrations27, and phenological traits28,29 of B. pendula are known to be substantial, and all these traits are known to affect herbivores and higher trophic level interactions2,30,31. Most of the studies that have been conducted using B. pendula have used genotypes that were originally randomly selected from a local B. pendula population, i.e. from a naturally regenerated forest stand < 0.9 ha. None of these earlier studies have, however, investigated the within-population genotypic variation in B. pendula insect herbivore species richness and community composition. We cloned 22 B. pendula genotypes, planted them in two common gardens separated at a regional scale (distance between sites about 30 km), and studied the relative importance of genetic variation in community patterns, comparing both local and regional environmental variation. In addition, we examined how strongly herbivores themselves can modify arthropod communities associated with B. pendula by suppressing herbivores from half of the saplings over one growing season in one common garden and surveying their arthropod communities the following season.","24 Feb 2014","Approved","Judith Myers, Department of Zoology, University of of British Columbia, Canada","Author Response 21 Mar 2014"," This is an interesting study on the role of tree genotypes on herbivorous insect attack of willow trees, Betula pendula, using a common garden approach in Finland.

Six blocks with 4 saplings of each genotype were used from which one sapling was randomly selected to give 6 replicates per genotype for the study of insect attack. Insect sampling was done largely based on the damage done over the summer.

Since caries is mainly a demineralization process, the high ratio of X-ray absorbance between calcium and the chemical elements of the organic content1, and the fact that the density of the mineral content is higher (more than 2 times) than that of the organic content2, radiography with microscopic resolution (microradiography, MR) is considered as a highly reliable gold standard for detecting variations in dentin mineral content. Also widely accepted as gold standards for dentin reactions are stereomicroscopy (SM; commonly referred as histology)3,4 and (to a lesser extent) polarized light microscopy with quinoline as the immersion medium (PLMQ)5. The acceptance of SW, the currently most used “gold standard”, is based on studies reporting opaque and translucent dentin under SM related to radiolucent and radiopaque dentin, respectively6–9. It is lacking, however, accuracy in numbers. To our knowledge, data regarding the accuracy of SM are available from only one study that included unerupted teeth and no data on translucent/sclerotic dentin10. In addition, early studies with MR reported cases classified as translucent dentin by transmitted light microscopy (where the interaction of light with dentin is similar to that under SM) that were then classified as demineralized dentin by the use of MR11–14.Currently the only evidence for the detection of dentin reactions by PLMQ is only qualitative5. Thus, research into the accuracy of SM and PLMQ is needed. Regarding the use of MR as a gold standard, it must be considered that images of microradiographic plates taken using transmitted light microscopy are commonly biased by the effect of heterogeneous illumination, which is inversely proportional to the objective magnification15. Heterogeneous illumination is expected to influence judgment of brightness16 (a procedure required for diagnosis from MR images), possibly including bias when other techniques are validated using MR.The aim of this study was three fold: to test the accuracy of both SM and PLMQ in detecting dentin reactions to natural caries; to test the hypothesis that elements of accuracy are influenced by the quality of the microradiographic image contrast; and to test the hypothesis that SM, PLMQ and MR (regardless of image contrast quality) detect dentin reactions equally.","13 Nov 2014","Approved","Chris Deery, The School of Clinical Dentistry, The University of Sheffield, UK","Author Response 03 Dec 2014"," This is an interesting paper which asks some interesting questions.

How B cells reactive to nuclear antigens are regulated has been extensively studied using transgenic (Tg) mice expressing auto-antibodies against DNA and RNA components, especially the anti-DNA H chain-Tg mouse lines 3H9 and 56R4–9. Studies using these auto-antibody-Tg mice demonstrated that self-reactive B cells that produce autoantibodies to nuclear antigens are deleted by apoptosis (clonal deletion)10, are functionally inactivated (clonal anergy)11 or change antigen specificity by immunoglobulin (Ig) V gene replacement (receptor editing)8,12, in the bone marrow before they migrate to the peripheral lymphoid organs. These self-tolerance mechanisms appear to be involved in the prevention of autoantibody production in normal individuals.CD40 is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family expressed in immune cells including B cells and dendritic cells13. Upon interaction with its ligand, CD40L (CD154), expressed mainly by activated T cells, CD40 transmits survival and activation signals in B cells13,14. In both patients with SLE and in SLE mouse models, CD40L is overexpressed by T cells and ectopically expressed in B cells15–17, and this excess CD40L expression appears to play a role in development of SLE, as treatment with antagonistic anti-CD40L antibody markedly reduces the severity of the disease in both humans and mice18.Using CD40L/56R double transgenic mice expressing both the anti-DNA H chain 56R and CD40L in B cells, we previously demonstrated that anti-Sm/RNP B cells are regulated by a novel tolerance mechanism in peripheral lymphoid tissue, i.e., deletion in splenic marginal zone (MZ), and that the MZ deletion is perturbed by excess CD40L19. In 56R mice, B cells that produce anti-Sm/RNP antibody appear in the splenic MZ, and are subsequently deleted there by apoptosis. When 56R mice are crossed with CD40L-Tg mice in which CD40 signaling is constitutively generated in B cells20, MZ deletion of anti-Sm/RNP B cells is perturbed, resulting in autoantibody production19. As anti-Sm/RNP antibodies are implicated in the pathogenesis of SLE1,2, MZ deletion appears to be important for preventing the development of SLE through deletion of pathogenic self-reactive B cells. Hence, a defect in MZ deletion by excess CD40L19 could play a role in the development of lupus by inducing the production of pathogenic anti-Sm/RNP antibody.Some self-reactive B cells including a part of anti-DNA B cells are silenced by clonal anergy in which B cells persist in the peripheral lymphoid organs but are unresponsive to antigen stimulation. Anergized self-reactive B cells are excluded from follicles or the MZ of the spleen. Instead, they are located in the red pulp and the T cell zone of the spleen, especially in the border between the T cell zone and the follicles, and undergo apoptosis21. Ig <U+03BB>1 L chain + B cells in the anti-DNA H chain-Tg mouse line 3H9 are reactive to DNA and are anergized9,22,23. Previously, we demonstrated that excess CD40L does not induce anti-DNA antibody production in 3H9 mice19. Nonetheless, it is possible that anti-DNA B cells in these mice are rescued from anergy by excess CD40L but are tolerized by some other mechanism as there are multiple tolerance mechanisms at different developmental stages of B cells. To address whether excess CD40L can reverse the anergy of self-reactive B cells, we crossed CD40L-Tg mice with 3H9 mice and examined the percentage and localization of Ig <U+03BB>1+ B cells. Our results demonstrated that excess CD40L does not expand anergized anti-DNA B cells or reverse their follicular exclusion, indicating that excess CD40 does not reverse anergy of self-reactive B cells. As excess CD40L does perturb MZ deletion of anti-Sm/RNP B cells, clonal anergy appears to be distinct from MZ deletion, although both of them induce apoptosis of self-reactive B cells in peripheral lymphoid tissue.","05 Mar 2014","Approved","Jennifer Marshall, University of Birmingham, UK",NA," With the addition of the animal numbers used, the graphs of data in figure 1 and the new images submitted I think that the data, and therefore the paper, is much improved.

Because of the relevance of modularity for network properties, it is important to assess it correctly. Several methods exist to measure network modularity, some of which rely on the optimization of a given criterion9,10, label propagation11, or combination of these approaches12,13. These methods return two elements. The first is a value of modularity for the networks, most often within the 0–1 interval. Each method often has a threshold value, above which a network is considered to be modular. Increasing values reflect an increasingly modular structure. The second element is a ""community partition"", i.e. the attribution of each node to a module.Recently, Thébault7 showed that different measures of modularity tailored to presence/absence matrices (i.e. networks in which links have no weight), gave roughly equal estimates of the significance of modularity, but differed in the community partition they returned (i.e. the identity of nodes composing each module varied). In such situations, one might look for a way to choose which community partition should be used. The challenge in this situation is that the criteria used by each optimisation method cannot be meaningfully compared, and so there is a need for a posteriori measurement of how strong the modular structure is, regardless of the method used to obtain the community partition. More importantly, this criterion should be different than the one used to track the progress of any optimisation algorithm.An important feature of modular networks is the occurrence of interactions between nodes of different modules. They contribute to the propagation of disturbances4, flow of information14,15, and cross-regulation of biological processes16, inter alia17. In addition to measuring how modular the network is, determining to what extent modules are connected, and to identify nodes and edges responsible for connecting modules, is thus valuable information. In this article, I propose an a posteriori measure of the proportion of interactions established between modules, i.e. edges connecting different communities. I apply this measure to the community partition identified by the Louvain method on 290 ecological networks, and show that it behaves in a similar way to other modularity measures.","08 Apr 2014","Approved","Daniel Carstensen, Department of Bioscience, Universidade Federal de São Paulo, Brazil","Author Response 06 Jan 2014"," I have no further issues with this submission.

This reflexive action, known as the nociceptive withdrawal reflex3, is an essential protective mechanism for interactions between parts of the body and the environment, allowing for quick removal from noxious stimuli. The relatively short-latency reflex responses occur as a result of transmission from Ad afferent fibers to the motor neuron pools of several muscles4. Previously, it was suggested that stimulation of these afferent fibers consistently produces excitatory postsynaptic potentials in flexor motor neurons and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in extensor motor neurons of the cat hindlimb5. However, fixed nociceptive input would limit the protective capabilities of the nervous system to only producing flexion at individual joints (e.g. elbow, shoulder), and a summary of more recent work has dispelled this hypothesis (see review by Clarke and Harris (2004)6).To initiate reflexive motor actions such as withdrawing the whole limb, nociceptive afferent input would need to be distributed to the motor neuron pools of muscles across several joints to coordinate the movement. In the hindlimb of rats activation of afferent neurons with receptive fields in a specific area of skin coordinates the activity of one or more muscles best suited to remove it from the noxious stimuli3,7. Specifically, the pairing of afferent neurons and resulting muscle activity was designated as reflex ""modules""3,7,8. Reflex modules are not limited to only activating the synergist muscles required to withdraw the limb, but can also inhibit muscles that would oppose it. Thus, organizing nociceptive sensory-motor interactions into reflex modules would result in a more efficient, coordinated limb withdrawal.It has been suggested that the reflex modules are shaped by use, or action-based sensory encoding9,10. As a purely protective mechanism, the nociceptive withdrawal reflex adapts or develops according to the repetitive motor actions performed and the environment in which there are constant sensory-motor interactions. Since most of these adaptations transpire early in post-natal development11–15 it is assumed that they shape the functional sensory-motor behaviors required later in maturity14. However, it is unknown how reflex modules are influenced by short-term action-based motor practice or use after development has ceased. Features such as habituation and dishabituation (wind-up), as well as human correlates of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), have been well described in relation to short-term synaptic plasticity in nociceptive pathways2,16–19. However, it is yet to be determined how short-term synaptic plasticity of nociceptive pathways controls the activation of reflex modules translating to the appropriate motor actions. Furthermore, the evidence presented for the activation of specific reflex modules has been demonstrated only by stimulating different receptive fields3,7.The purpose of the present study is to test the adaptability of the nociceptive withdrawal reflex through two different tasks. First, the study seeks to determine if different nociceptive reflex modules are activated in the upper-limb of unimpaired humans by stimulating the same receptive field with the arm in different static arm positions by independently changing either the elbow or shoulder joint angles. We hypothesized that the static muscle length changes would alter group II afferent input that has been shown to have a strong excitatory input to interneurons regulating the withdrawal response20–22. Specifically, if there was modular organization in the spinal cord, we expected to observe different patterns of muscle activity (latencies, amplitude), and subsequent endpoint forces, evoked by stimulation in the various positions. Secondly, the study seeks to determine whether the protective motor function of the nociceptive withdrawal reflex in the upper-limb could be modified by short-term practice of a similar or opposing motor action voluntarily triggered by a non-noxious stimuli.","06 Mar 2014","Approved","Hong-You Ge, Center for Sensory-Motor Interaction, Aalborg University, Denmark",NA," I have read this submission.

The fact that hundreds of cellular proteins have been identified as the targets of protein arginine methylation supports the idea that arginine methylation regulates diverse cellular processes6. Arginine methylation is catalyzed by protein arginine methyltransferases (Prmts) that transfer a methyl group from S-adenosyl methionine (AdeMet) to protein substrates. To date, nine protein arginine methyltransferases have been identified in the mammalian genome and have been classified as type I, type II and type III enzymes by the activity of producing <U+03C9>-NG,NG-asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), <U+03C9>-NG,NG-symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA), and <U+03C9>-NG-monomethylarginine (MMA), respectively2,4,7.Among the family of Prmts, Prmt7 is unique in that it possesses two AdoMet-binding domains, which may have resulted from a gene duplication event8. As for many of the Prmts, histones are among the identified substrate molecules, suggesting a functional role for Prmt7 in regulating gene expression as a chromatin modifier. Initial work indicated that H2A and H4 were symmetrically dimethylated by Prmt7 in vitro9, whereas several studies have reported that Prmt7 only produces MMA on histones and other substrates8,10,11. A recent study indicated that Prmt7 symmetrically dimethylates H4R3 and H2AR3 in a manner that contributes to the repression of expression of genes involved in DNA repair12. Another study revealed that Prmt7-mediated H4R3 symmetric dimethylation antagonizes MLL4-catalyzed H3K4 methylation on neuron-specific gene promoters during differentiation13, suggesting that Prmt7 might negatively regulate tissue differentiation by its chromatin-modifying activity. Aside from the role in neuronal differentiation, the regulatory function of Prmt7 in the differentiation of other lineages has not been reported.Adipocyte differentiation is one of the most intensively studied differentiation processes. Both human and mouse mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that reside in fat pads and bone marrow undergo lineage commitment and terminal differentiation to become mature adipocytes14–16. The adipogenic differentiation process is controlled by a number of tissue-specific transcription factors, such as the CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins (C/EBPs), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR<U+03B3>), and numerous chromatin remodeling and modifying enzymes including the ATP-dependent SWI/SNF complex and Prmts17–20. It has been shown that Prmt5 interacts with Brg1-based SWI/SNF complex21 and facilitates the binding of Brg1 to the PPAR<U+03B3> and to PPAR<U+03B3> target promoters to facilitate the activation of adipogenic genes19. Furthermore, Prmt4, which also has been shown to interact with Brg1-based SWI/SNF complex22, acts as a co-activator of PPAR<U+03B3> to promote adipocyte gene expression20. Prmt7 had been recently shown to interact with Brg1-based SWI/SNF complex12, but whether Prmt7 has functional roles in adipocyte differentiation remains unclear.In the present study, we examined the role of Prmt7 in adipocyte differentiation in mouse C3H10T1/2 embryonic mesenchymal cells and in C/EBPa-reprogrammed murine NIH3T3 fibroblasts. By knocking down and over-expressing Prmt7, we showed that Prmt7 has no effect on lipid accumulation and adipogenic gene expression in differentiating cells. Based on the results, we concluded that Prmt7 is not required for differentiation in tissue culture models of adipogenesis.","13 Feb 2014","Approved","Yaacov Barak, Department of Pathology, Magee-Womens Research Institute and the University of Pittsburgh, USA",NA," In this manuscript, Hu et al. performed a series of high-quality, well-designed and properly controlled experiments in search of potential functions of the protein arginine methylase Prmt7 in adipogenesis of C3H10T1/2 cell cultures. The motivation for the experiment was the group’s previous work that identified central functions of the closely related Prmt5 in the process, which led them to hypothesize guilt-by-homology. Moreover, hints of developmental functions of Prmt7 in other systems, such as neuronal differentiation, warranted testing a broader effect on differentiation in other system. The conclusion that Prmt7 has no bearing on adipogenesis is fully justified by the clean data, which showed no effect in both loss and gain-of-function approaches. It is reassuring that the experiment was conducted by the same group that identified the roles of Prmt5 in the process, and thus the negative data are likely not due to experimental system variability. In the Discussion, the authors allow that this lack of effect may be the result of compensation by redundant methylases; this is probably an overly cautious, “just-in-case” argument, considering that even in most cases of true redundancy there are at least some quantitative effects, which is not the case here whatsoever. It is more likely that arginine methylases are target-specific and have a clear partition of labor among them. With heaps of negative data buried in the archives of many laboratories which never see the light of day, the team has to be commended for publishing their own negative data to seal the issue and allow other research groups that might be drawn to the question to steer away and focus on more productive hypotheses.

Due to the minimal risk profile, arising as function of the very low current delivered to the scalp, and the relatively inexpensive nature of the device, it has high potential as a clinical tool. Tentative evidence thus far suggests that tDCS may be effective in ameliorating neurological and psychiatric illnesses associated with cognitive deficits. Prominent amongst these are recent developments in the study of the treatment of addiction, depression, schizophrenia and stroke5. However, questions remain over stimulation condition blinding6, optimal stimulation frequency7 and appropriate electrode placement8 as these parameters can strongly influence the efficacy of the stimulation device, the induced neuronal activity and moreover, the interpretation of stimulation effects on cognitive performance. Questions have also been raised about appropriate behavioural and stimulation controls9.Many studies have reported enhanced task performance in healthy volunteers following application of the excitatory anodal electrode to a location of the scalp corresponding to a task-relevant region of the brain, including: the temporal parietal junction to enhance social cognition10; inferior frontal cortex to enhance target detection11,12; Wernicke’s area to enhance visual picture naming13; and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) to enhance decision making1,14 and working memory3,4,7. The application of the excitatory tDCS electrode to the scalp is thought to cause an increase in neuronal excitability in the stimulated area by altering the resting potential15. To complete the electrical circuit, the reference or inhibitory cathodal electrode must be placed somewhere on the head or body being stimulated.The majority of studies exploring cognitive enhancement using tDCS have targeted DLPFC as their region of excitation while the inhibitory electrode has typically been placed on the contralateral supra-orbit (or DLPFC). For example, in a single blind investigation using this electrode montage, Ohn et al.4 found that 30 minutes of 1 mA tDCS while participants performed the n-back task led to significant improvements in task performance over sham during stimulation only. However, placing the reference electrode on the scalp introduces a potential confound in the interpretation of any resulting behavioural effects: these could arise as a result of excitation, inhibition, or a combination of the two electrodes. The location of the reference electrode, whether extra or intra -cephalic, has been show to play a prominent role in the efficacy of the excitatory electrode16.The n-back17 is a cognitive task commonly used to assess aspects of executive function, and is thought to engage working memory in particular. Although criticisms have been made with respect to its construct validity18, the n-back has frequently been used in the context of functional neuroimaging experiments in both healthy volunteers and patients with psychiatric and neurological illnesses. The results of these studies consistently implicate a network of brain regions including parietal cortex and DLPFC, which are engaged with increasing cognitive load during n-back performance19. Importantly, altered DLPFC function is associated with several psychiatric conditions20–22. For example, research using the n-back has identified that the DLPFC is hyperactive in patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD)23,24, suggesting that MDD patients may need to use greater resources to achieve the same level of performance. Similar findings have been reported in schizophrenia25.Working memory dysfunction, and executive function deficits more broadly, have been found across a number of psychopathologies, including attention deficit disorder, autistic spectrum disorder, traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia and depression26–28. Indeed, executive function performance has been identified as a tractable endophenotype to explore across neuropsychiatric illnesses due to its prevalence, particularly in depression and schizophrenia29,30. Thus, there is significant potential for non-invasive brain stimulation techniques such as tDCS to be applied clinically to ameliorate cognitive dysfunction. However, in order to establish whether tDCS has the potential to improve clinical conditions through modulatory effects on executive function, it is pertinent to first establish the effects of specific stimulation parameters in healthy volunteers.A recent single-blind within-subjects investigation by Zaehle et al.31 demonstrated that 15 minutes of 1 mA excitatory tDCS applied to left DLPFC during rest, with the inhibitory electrode placed ipsilaterally at the mastoid, resulted in enhanced post-stimulation performance on the 2-back task in comparison with cathodal, but not sham, stimulation. Importantly, Zaehle et al.31 utilized a fronto-extracephalic montage, which attenuates interpretational difficulties as the reference electrode and its position can affect the efficacy of tDCS and the underlying neuronal activity16; it remains unknown whether contralateral or ipsilateral positioned reference electrodes or bifrontal montages are superior in the stimulation of DLPFC. Furthermore, it remains to be determined whether stimulation during a task or while at rest is more beneficial. Andrews et al.3 found tentative evidence to suggest that DLPFC tDCS applied concurrently with a cognitive task may provide more robust effects on subsequent working memory performance that stimulation during rest.Here, we sought to build on prior research3,4,31 by conducting a double-blind between-subjects experiment to examine whether excitatory DLPFC tDCS applied across two days would lead to enhancement of n-back performance during and post-stimulation. Specifically, we assessed whether excitatory fronto-extracerebral DLPFC tDCS, with the reference on the contralateral cheek, could improve performance on the 3-back in healthy volunteers across two stimulation days. We hypothesized that those receiving active stimulation would have greater task performance improvement, relative to baseline, in comparison with sham stimulation recipients.","18 Mar 2014","Approved","Marian Berryhill, Department of Psychology, University of Nevada, USA","Author Response 10 Dec 2013"," I believe the authors have made the appropriate revisions.  I have read this submission.

In response to predation pressure, many prey species have co-opted predator odors as kairomones; chemicals emitted by one species, usually for inter-species communication, but intercepted by other species resulting in benefit for the receiver and detriment of the emitter. In this role, predator odors such as urine, fecal material or body odors initiate a rapid avoidance response in prey, thus reducing the probability of successful predation1,2. Such avoidance of predator cues needs to be ‘traded-off’ against foraging opportunities. In view of this, it can be speculated that a kairomonal responses may not be an absolute all-or-nothing phenomenon. Rather avoidance is expected to be relative to the intensity of the predator cue. Implicit in this speculation is the idea that animals can quantitatively perceive differences in kairomonal strength.A wide variety of animals can make quantitative estimates of percepts such as time, foraging opportunities, efforts and rewards3–7. These quantitative estimates are often derived using a comparative representational system that is dependent on the ratios between opposing quantities3–7. The ability to make quantitative estimates is important because it allows calibration of behavioral responses to incipient environmental opportunities and challenges. In accordance with the comparative nature of such perceptual systems, it can be predicted that greater quantities of kairomones evoke greater response i.e. that the response is dose-dependent. More importantly, sensitivity to changes in the magnitude of a stimulus decreases when stimulus magnitude increases. In other words, the discrimination threshold (i.e. the ‘just-noticeable difference’ between two stimuli of different intensities) is smaller when both stimuli are weak compared to when both stimuli are strong. This formulation is often termed Weber’s law8, and is a fundamental property of many percepts.Kairomonal communication has been widely studied in insects9–12. Additionally, the neurobiology and physiology of rodent kairomones has attracted significant scientific interest in the recent past1,13. Yet, the perceptual properties of kairomonal communication in mammals have so far been under studied, including, the dose-responsivity of kairomonal communication14 and the relationship of discrimination threshold to stimulus magnitude.House mice (Mus musculus) are predated by rats (Rattus norvegicus)15–17 and accordingly, the mice express innate avoidance to rat odors18,19. In this report, we investigate the dose-responsivity and discrimination threshold of kairomonal communication in mice.","30 Dec 2013","Approved","Kazumi Osada, Division of Physiology, Health Sciences University of Hokkaido, Japan","Author Response 30 Nov 2013"," Although I do not feel the paper is perfectly acceptable, I admit it has been improved by the authors, and am not inclined to reject the paper anymore.

In fact, it is stated that the renal pressure/volume control system adjusts arterial pressure with “infinite gain” and that the renal function curve and rate of salt and water intake are the “two sole determinants of the long-term arterial pressure”1. Yet while it is certain that at any steady level of arterial pressure the rates of salt and water intake and excretion are balanced, there is considerable debate over how this balance is achieved, and thus what are the long-term determinants of arterial pressure2–5.One viewpoint is that the acute relationship between pressure and salt excretion—the acute pressure-natriuresis mechanism—represents a physiological input-output relationship and that alterations to this mechanism underlie most (if not all) chronic changes in pressure1,6. While competing ideas identify the nervous system and its influence on the heart and vasculature as the primary long-term controllers of arterial pressure3,4, the hypothesis that long-term control of blood pressure is achieved through the renal pressure-diuresis represents the dominant thinking in the field7.The most widely recognized model of long-term blood pressure control is the model developed over several decades by Guyton and colleagues. The 1972 realization of the model6 invokes approximately 160 variables, and several hundred adjustable parameters8. More recent versions of the model involve many thousands of variables and tens of thousands of parameters9,10. While several realizations of the Guyton model are or have been disseminated as computer programs, human readable expositions of the various versions of the model are lacking. Moreover, there is no published report of any of these models in which the governing equations are defined, the parameter values are provided, the data that were used for model identification are reported, and the model identification process and results are reported. Indeed, it is unlikely if not impossible that even the relatively simple 1972 version of the model was formally identified. These facts unfortunately make this seminal work largely impenetrable and possibly irreproducible. Most critically, the Guyton-Coleman model is based on the assertion that arterial blood pressure is, under all circumstances, controlled primarily by the kidney11. Therefore the Guyton-Coleman model cannot be used to explore alternative hypotheses.In the Systems Approach for PHysiological Integration of Renal, cardiac and respiratory functions (SAPHIR) project, Thomas et al.8 aimed to develop and disseminate a core “model of human physiology targeting the short- and long-term regulation of blood pressure, body fluids and homeostasis of the major solutes” including “the main regulatory sensors (baro- and chemoreceptors) and nervous (autonomic control) and hormonal regulators (antidiuretic hormone, aldosterone and angiotensin)”. The project goal is to, for the first time, provide an open-source transparent model integrating these systems. In 2008, the SAPHIR group published a core model of circulation and volume exchange across fluid compartments that is derived from the Guyton models, consisting of 20 equations and perhaps less than 100 parameters8. This model does not account for adaptation of the acute pressure-diuresis/natriuresis function to chronic changes in arterial pressure or volume/salt loading. Thus, it does not capture the concept of the chronic renal function curve, which is thought to be of fundamental importance to the long-term regulation of arterial pressure. Recently Averina et al.4 reported a mathematical model of long-term control of arterial pressure that captures the concept of chronic adaptation of pressure-natriuresis and, to our knowledge, represents the only published model incorporating the concept of adaptation of the acute pressure-natriuresis relationship in response to changes in salt/volume loading. Thus, the model of Averina et al. represents the model of record of regulation of blood pressure accounting for the chronic renal function curve. Yet, this model was developed to illustrate that the chronic renal function curve need not represent a physiological input-output mechanism, and to introduce an alternative description of the long-term regulation of arterial pressure and the etiology of salt- and angiotensin-dependent hypertension.Similar to the goals of the SAPHIR project, we developed a mathematical model of the Guyton concept of long-term control of arterial pressure, analysed its behavior and compared its predictions to experimental observations. Similarly, an open-source transparent model integrating these systems is provided. The approach pursued here differs from that of Thomas and colleagues in that while the SAPHIR project explicitly centers on translating the components of the Guyton model into an explicitly defined core model, our goal is to develop a model from scratch in which all model components and associated data are formally identified based on experimental data. Furthermore, given the demands of model identification and validation, our goals are necessarily more narrowly constrained than those of the SAPHIR project and of the original Guyton-Coleman models. In our study, a model is constructed in the spirit of the Guyton-Coleman models, adopting a practical approach to data-driven phenomenological representations of physiological systems, rather than aiming for physical and mechanistic realism.Specifically, we have developed a model of the long-term control of arterial pressure that captures the Guyton concept of pressure-diuresis/natriuresis as physiological input-output relationships. The model is designed to meet the following criteria: 1. The model accounts for the effects of the baroreflex on the circulation, the heart, and the kidney, and the effects of the renin-angiotensin system on the circulation, the heart, and the kidney; 2. The model is explicitly documented for definition and reproducibility: all model equations are reported herein and justified based on experimental data; 3. Parameter values are reported and justified: All parameter values are estimated by comparing model simulations to measured data. The identified model is used to probe physiological mechanisms underlying the chronic renal function curve, to provide insight into how chronic stimulation of the baroreflex leads to chronic reductions in arterial pressure, and to generate hypotheses regarding the etiology of primary hypertension.","12 Dec 2013","Approved","Patrick Hannaert, INSERM U1082, France","Author Response 26 Nov 2013"," The authors acutely revised the manuscript, provided convincing explanations/comments, answered key issues, and nicely complemented their work.

It involves sexual development, sexual and reproductive health, interpersonal relationships, affection and intimacy1. Abstinence-only sexual education teaches the adolescents to abstain from premarital sexual intercourse because of the advantages it offers. Such advantages include prevention of unintended pregnancies and prevention of contracting HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections. According to the Federal Law of the United States of America (USA), every school-aged child should not engage in sexual activity2,3. The USA Federal law further advocates sexual activity within the confines of monogamous marital relationship to guard against adverse psychological and physical effects associated with premarital sexual activity. Bearing children outside marriage has serious effects on the child, the mother and the society as a whole3–6. The Federal Law of United States of America also posited that, abstaining from sexual activity outside marriage allows for maturity and understanding of self3,7.Studies disclose that it is comprehensive sexual education and not abstinence-only that will delay first sexual activity2,3,8–14. Abstinence-only sexual education lacks strong evidence of effectiveness because of faulty designs3,15,16a. Abstinence-only sexual education does not positively affect the sexual behaviour of adolescents, lacks the message of sexually transmitted infections to its recipients and the positive effect in a few cases does not last for a long time16b,17.According to Bruckner and Bearman18 and a study by the Alan Guttmacher Institute19 those that embrace abstinence-only sexual education still have sex before they get married. There is no difference between adolescents that accept abstinence-only sexual education and those who do not in terms of number of sexual partners and ages of first sexual intercourse17. Abstinence-only sexual education does not reduce the scourge of HIV/AIDS16b. Bennett and Assefi saw the failure to provide adolescents with information about contraception as a serious weakness of abstinence only sexual-education20.The proponents of abstinence-only sexual education frown at the role of comprehensive sexual education in emphasising so much on the reliability of contraceptives while de-emphasising their failure rates and the possibility of contracting new sexually transmitted diseases including HIV/AIDS21. They further frowned at the double message of comprehensive sexual education such as encouraging the delay of first sexual intercourse and promoting the use of contraceptives22. They are also blamed for stressing the possibility of contracting sexually transmitted infections to the extent of falsifying information to establish the negative aspect of comprehensive sexual education1,23,24. Studies further reveal that sexual educators do not stress enough on sexual intercourse or bring in sensitive issues such as homosexuality and abortions. The adolescents posited that the basic message is that they should not have sex19,25–27. The proponents of comprehensive sexual education attributed the ineffectiveness of condoms and contraceptives to poor-quality research28.Abstinence-only sexual health education is also blamed for withholding information on the positive aspects of sexual relationships, while magnifying the emotional risks and pitfalls associated with premarital sexual activity1,24. Modern lifestyle is characterised by a high rate of broken marriages, predisposing an individual to having many sexual partners1. According to some studies the age of first marriage has risen to 30 years, with a fifth of such marriages ending in divorce within a period of five years29. Conversely the age at first sexual intercourse has dropped to 16 years with very few people having their husbands as their first sexual partners30,31. The data on adolescents’ sexual behaviour in the developing world with a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS suggests unacceptability of abstinence-only sexual education. Some countries do not accept abstinence-only sexual education even in the face of the high prevalence of HIV/AIDS. Some countries expect sexual educators to encourage adolescents to delay their first sexual experience while also providing education on contraception and sexual health services32. In some countries, the requirements for teaching any type of sexual education are clearly outlined for the sexual educators33.Most studies reveal comprehensive sexual education as the preference of parents and adolescents34–36. Studies advocate comprehensive sexual education for unmarried sexually active adolescents3. Studies also recommend abstinence-only sexual education with information on contraception and risk-reduction behaviour for the few sexually inactive adolescents. These align with the position of Collins and Priya that parents and adolescents prefer comprehensive sexual education to abstinence-only sexual education37. Most studies revealed that the opinion of adults differs on the type of sexual education to teach adolescents. Most of the adults feel 7th to 9th graders should be taught ‘abstinence only’ while some advocate the teaching of contraception use38. Most studies also show that a greater percentage of adolescents prefer sexual orientation that will teach them about the use of contraception and sexually transmitted infections than abstinence-only sexual education39. Other studies reported the positive outcome of abstinence-only sexual education ranging from reduced sexual activity, pregnancies, abortions to more successful deliveries40. In line with this, John and Jemmott disclosed the success of abstinence-only sexual education in reducing sexual activity among youths41. In support of the findings of this new study, Rector submitted that out of 15 scientific evaluations of abstinence-only sexual education, 11 of them demonstrated its effectiveness in reducing adolescent sexual activity42.A survey of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy in 2001 showed that 93% of abstinence sexual education came from the society43. They concluded that abstinence-only sexual education is the only 100% effective method to prevent teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases4. They further reminded that condoms cannot provide 100% protection against unplanned pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections and also that premarital sex can lead to life threatening health problems such as abortion and its associated complications5. They feel burdened that sexual, contraceptive and HIV information can provoke early sexual initiation among the adolescents5. Abstinence-only sexual education has positively produced a corresponding decrease in teenage pregnancy4. Studies have demonstrated that religion acts as a deterrent to early sexual activity5. In line with this, many adolescents submitted that morals, values and religious beliefs significantly influence the decision to have sex or not.In deciding whether or not to have sex, the Organization of Concerned Women for America also decried the outcome of sex without love or responsibility supported by public policies. This results in the breakdown of nuclear families, increases crime, poverty, teen births and AIDS which in turn negatively affects the health of the general public. This only shows lack of values5.","10 Mar 2014","Approved","Laxmi Baxi, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, NYU Langone Medical Center , USA","Author Response 04 Jun 2013"," I have read this submission.

Karst topography is characterized by a very slow formation of soil from the carbonate rock, leading to low water retention capacity1,2. China’s karst topography is located mainly in the southwestern region, which is also characterized by diversified landscape types and a dense population. Deforestation was once one of the most serious environmental problems in China’s karst region, and was mainly due to fuel wood production, agricultural expansion, and livestock husbandry. This land use has caused the ecosystem of the karst region to degrade beyond its already poor condition. As a result, many woodlands have degraded to rocky desert in many of the karst regions in southwest Guizhou Province. Karst ecosystems are very fragile. If destroyed, the soil regeneration process is slow, and thus karst ecosystems are only restored gradually, if at all. Precipitation is sufficient in this region, but the woody plants are supposedly subjected to temporary water stress. This water stress results from low soil water-holding capability, and the high leakiness of limestone rock2,3. Numerous studies have simulated the above environments, and the data generated has shown that plants are suffering from conditions of temporary water-stress2,3. In most of these studies, potted seedlings were used, and the experiments were conducted under controlled environments (e.g. greenhouses). It is risky to extrapolate the situation for mature tree species in their natural conditions from data from potted seedlings under controlled conditions. So far, reports on woody plant growth and physiological response to temporary water deficiency in the karst field areas have been sparse. This is particularly so for mature woody plants. Investigating how woody plants respond functionally to differently degraded habitats will help understand the adaptive mechanisms that these indigenous species have to their habitats. This will also help in optimizing the selection of tree species for forest ecosystem restoration in karst regions.For our study, we selected two types of forests with contrasting karst habitats in the west and southwest of Guizhou Province: a well-developed secondary deciduous and evergreen broad-leaved mixed forest at Tianlongshan Mountain, and a severely degraded forest dominated by spare deciduous woody species at Daxiagu. We made in situ measurements of eco-physiological traits for the dominant tree species in three consecutive growth seasons (2007–2009) to address the following questions:1) Compared with tree species in the well-developed forest habitat, are the eco-physiological traits down-regulated for the tree species in the degraded karst habitat?2) Is there a difference in stomatal sensitivity between tree species in the two contrasting forests?3) How do nutrients affect the eco-physiological characteristics of the tree species in the two contrasting forests?","07 Jul 2014","Approved with Reservations","Jessica Gurevitch, Department of Ecology and Evolution, Stony Brook University, USA","Author Response 17 Jul 2014"," This is a very comprehensive ecophysiological study carried out on a wide range of woody species in two contrasting karst sites over the course of three years. The extent and duration of the study is far greater than most comparable field studies, and the paper provides a great deal of valuable information on the physiological responses of woody species in these sites. The differences found between the degraded and intact karst forest must be considered as hypotheses rather than conclusive demonstration of differences between degraded and intact forest, because of the limitations of the experimental design, as discussed in my review of the previous version. Because of the way the study was set up, a more accurate title would be: Ecophysiological responses of dominant tree species in two karst forest sites in southwestern China. I understand that this paper represents an enormous amount of work; ideally, the experimental design could have been thought through with respect to being able to test the factors most of interest before initiating all of that excellent work. In addition, the study design  is not a factorial ANOVA; it is a hierarchical design with a nested structure and thus should have been analyzed as such (thereby changing the F tests and P levels); the reported values for the ANOVA are therefore inaccurate.

More than 90% of human genes are estimated to be alternatively spliced1,2, producing multiple transcripts and (often) different protein sequences from a single locus. The number of variants of a gene ranges from two to potentially thousands3. The resulting proteins may exhibit different and sometimes antagonistic functional and structural properties4, and may inhabit the same cell with the resulting phenotype representing a balance between their expression levels5. Defects in splicing have been implicated in human diseases, including cancer6–9. Developing a comprehensive catalog of splice variant annotations across a wide range of tissues and conditions is important not only as part of our efforts to create a complete gene list for the human genome, but also to serve as a reference for differential expression studies aiming to identify molecular markers of disease.Annotation of alternative splicing has traditionally been based on cDNA (expressed sequence tags (EST), mRNA) sequence data from public repositories such as dbEST, RefSeq10, and the Mammalian Gene Collection11. These data sources were compiled over many years, from independent contributions by thousands of investigators working on different genes and systems, and are therefore inconsistent in their coverage of the transcriptome in general and of each gene individually. Because these resources were generated using Sanger sequencing, they were relatively expensive to produce, but despite the cost have insufficient depth to capture the diversity of splicing variations in human cells. RNA-seq technology produces vastly more sequence data in a cost-effective way and in a much shorter amount of time, allowing a deep characterization of the transcriptome in a variety of cells and conditions2,12,13, but so far little has been done to systematically assess its potential14. Starting from one of the most complete sets of RNA-seq data available, the Illumina Human Body Map, we addressed the questions: ""how much alternative splicing do we find?"" and ""how does alternative splicing vary among tissues?"" We used this data set, spanning 16 tissues and containing over 2.5 billion sequences, to build a comprehensive catalog of alternative splicing (AS) within each tissue. We also compared AS profiles across tissue types to derive insights into the role of AS in shaping transcriptome differences.","22 Apr 2014","Approved","Manuel Corpas, The Genome Analysis Center, UK","Author Response 18 Nov 2013"," I am satisfied with the current revision.

Computing power has not kept pace with this rapid increase in bioinformatics. Therefore, it has become critical to develop clever algorithms to reduce the time needed to search such databases and arrive at solutions to the treatment of genetically determined diseases1. Genetic algorithms provide new hope to overcome this dilemma. Genetic algorithms attempt to copy the principle of “survival of the fittest”, using Darwin’s theory of evolution to find a satisfactory solution. In essence, a group of random solutions is created and ranked, after which the best solutions are allowed to “interbreed”. During interbreeding, small mutations are allowed to add an element of randomness, and in this way aid the genetic algorithm in finding the optimal solution2.The applications of genetic algorithms (GAs) are well known and far ranging3. Because of their versatility, GAs have been widely and successfully used to optimize practical problems such as determining a long sequence of base pairs in a genetic database, scheduling drilling operations in a circuit-board factory, and data mining, among others4. However, one major problem faced by GAs is premature convergence, in which the algorithm becomes trapped in a local optimum and is unable to find the global optimum5.This study focuses on the use of mutations in GAs. Normally, the mutations occur at a constant rate, known as the mutation rate. However, use of a fixed mutation rate can produce sub-optimal solutions5. We propose a new, variable mutation rate that uses a pseudoderivative to take into account the time that a GA can be stuck at a certain point. The longer the algorithm has been stuck at a local optimum, the more likely it is that a mutation will occur. This addition of a greater element of randomness to the algorithm allows it to move from the local optimum and look for better solutions. In this paper, we show that the proposed variable mutation rate outperforms fixed mutation rates and other common search algorithms in the effectiveness of their solutions.","12 Mar 2014","Approved","Christos Ouzounis, Computational Genomics Unit and Institute of Agrobiotechnology, National Center for Research & Technology, Greece","Author Response 19 Nov 2013"," The authors have addressed many of the concerns raised.  I have read this submission.

It can be found in several important human parasites, such as Trypanosoma and Leishmania2. In humans, the MVA pathway operates alone and produces a variety of critical end products, including cholesterol, steroid hormones, dolichols and the prenyl moiety of cancer-associated cell signaling proteins like RAS3–6. In plants, the cytosolic IPP provided by the MVA pathway serves as precursor for the synthesis of sterols, brassinosteroids, polyprenols, dolichols and most sesquiterpenes and to some extent as a substrate for protein prenylation (cf.7,8). Moreover, cytosolic IPP is imported into the mitochondria, where it serves as precursor for ubiquinone9–11.The alternative pathway (or MEP-pathway) for the synthesis of isoprenoids occurs in eubacteria, cyanobacteria, and the plastids of phototrophic algae and plants12–19. In plants, the precursors, provided by the plastidial MEP pathway are used for the biosynthesis of essential isoprenoids of the photosynthetic apparatus such as carotenoids, the side-chains of chlorophyll and plastoquinone, as well as for isoprene, tocopherols, phylloquinones and the phytohormones ABA and gibberellin20, with ABA being a cleavage product of carotenoids, like the more recently discovered strigolactones21,22. In addition to these ubiquitous compounds in plants, the MEP pathway is the route for the biosynthesis of the vast majority of plant terpenoids, including countless secondary metabolites with defensive, allelopathic or signaling properties11,18,23 (and Hemmerlin et al.24 for review of literature). Furthermore, precursors derived from the MEP pathway are used for the post-translational modification of certain proteins by the covalent addition of a farnesyl-(C15) or geranylgeranyl (C20) residue, a process commonly referred to as protein prenylation (cf. the accompanying paper25 and literature cited therein).In preceding studies investigating the differential effect of a series of inhibitors of isoprenoid biosynthesis and function in cell cycle progression in unsynchronized and synchronized BY-2 cells26, it had been observed that blockage of protein farnesylation by chaetomellic acid not only led to a considerable percentage increase in dead cells during the culture period, but also to a specific arrest in the transition from G2 into M phase. By contrast, mevinolin for instance (which inhibits the key-regulatory enzyme HMG-CoA reductase in the cytosolic MVA pathway) arrested cells mainly at the transition from G1 to S phase27. This latter finding is most likely due to the lack of some MVA-derived signal formed at the end of mitotic phase that might be implied in the regulation of the cytoplasmic pH28. These and other observations prompted a series of further studies in which the possibility that the plastidial MEP pathway could complement MVA deficiency was tested. Indeed it was demonstrated that exogenously added deoxyxylulose (DX, the dephosphorylated first product of the MEP pathway) could overcome mevinolin-induced growth inhibition, even more efficiently than exogenous MVA29. To enter the plastidial MEP route, this DX needs conversion into its phosphate (DXP) by a cytosolic xylulose kinase30, followed by translocation into plastids. As a logical follow-up, and in view of early reports that in plants geranylgeranylated proteins seem to be present in higher quantities than farnesylated ones31,32, we embarked on studying this phenomenon more closely. Our interest is not only focused on elucidation of the biosynthetic origin of farnesyl and geranylgeranyl residues, but also on the action of inhibitors on precursor availability and on the specificity of prenyltransferases. For instance, we could demonstrate the incorporation of 14C-DX into proteins in BY-2 cells29.The central element of our recent studies was an in vivo-visualization system based on a stably transformed tobacco BY-2 (TBY-2) cell line for monitoring the prenylation status of a GFP fusion protein. Isoprenylation of proteins, which occurs in all eukaryotic cells, involves the covalent attachment of a C15 (farnesyl) or C20 (geranylgeranyl) group to a C-terminal CaaX motif, followed by a series of post-prenylation reactions. This lipidic post-translational modification plays an important role in the correct membrane targeting of certain proteins and in their interactions with other proteins.This system consisted of a dexamethasone-inducible cell line that expressed a reporter protein (GFP) fused to the carboxy-terminal basic domain of the rice calmodulin (CaM61), which naturally bears a CaaL geranylgeranylation motif (GFP-BD-CVIL). After induction, the prenylated fusion protein predominantly associated with the plasma membrane. By using pathway-specific inhibitors, we demonstrated that inhibition of the MEP pathway with oxoclomazone and fosmidomycin, as well as inhibition of the protein geranylgeranyltransferase type 1 (PGGT-1), triggered a shift in the localization of the GFP-BD-CVIL protein from the plasma membrane to the nucleus1. By contrast, inhibition of the MVA pathway (by mevinolin) or protein farnesyltransferases did not affect the localization of the chimeric fusion protein. Among other experiments, complementation assays with pathway-specific intermediates were performed and clearly indicated that the precursors for the geranylgeranylation of the fusion protein in tobacco BY-2 cells were predominantly provided by the MEP pathway1.However, at the end of this previous study several questions remained unsolved that will be addressed in more detail in the present work, including the impact of inhibitors of sterol biosynthesis and post-prenylation reactions on the subcellular localization of the His6-tagged GFP-BD-CVIL fusion protein. In order to prove that the present bioassay was not only able to serve as a qualitative approach for the identification of new drug candidates, but also as a statistical tool to compare the potential drug candidates with other known inhibitors in vivo, we also performed a quantitative analysis of the intracellular distribution of GFP-DB-CVIL in response to different concentrations of novel prodrugs, targeting the early steps of the MEP pathway.","20 Nov 2013","Approved","Angelos Kanellis, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Aristotle University of Thessanoliki, Greece","Author Response 13 Nov 2013"," I believe the authors have successfully addressed the reviewer comments and thus, I again approve the publication of this article.

These effects are often demonstrated by pre-cuing a subject in a subtle manner (for example, by changing the colour of the ink or cover page in a written examination) and measuring performance in the exam as a function of cue colour.These effects appear to be remarkably robust. For example, Elliot, Maier, Moller, Friedman & Meinhardt1 showed that subjects performing a series of demanding cognitive tests performed worse when they were pre-cued with the colour red than when they were cued with control colours such as green, blue or grey. This effect was found across a wide range of cue conditions, exposure times, subjects, environments and even across two continents1. Similar effects have been demonstrated in a series of other experiments. Mehta and Zhu2 demonstrated that blue and red pre-cues similar to those described above influenced performance in tasks. In particular, blue cues led to better performance in creative-oriented, divergent tasks whilst red cues facilitated superior performance in detail-oriented, convergent tasks.The effect can even be driven by colour language. For example, in a series of experiments Lichtenfeld, Maier, Elliot & Pekrun3 showed that processing the word 'red' significantly impaired performance on both analogy and numeric IQ tasks. The most striking aspect of this research is the subtlety with which the colour manipulation took place. In one experiment in Germany, participants were simply assigned to either the 'red' (‘rot’) or 'place' (‘ort’) group without a visual colour exemplar. In another experiment the colour manipulation took the form of potential colour words in answers to a multiple choice-question. The effect has also been found when the colour stimulus was entirely incidental to the task. In one experiment the colour manipulation was the copyright label on a cover which read; 'Hogreffe Series of Tests' followed by either the word 'Red' or 'Grey'. Participants were not instructed to read the text but were required to wait with the page open until instructed to start. It seems that in these experiments only the neural evocation of the concept of a colour is required to influence performance.These results are now commonly framed within a theory known as the ‘Colour-in-Context’ (CIC) theory4. This formalizes the idea that colour carries semantic messages but that the behaviour resulting from these messages depends on context. In an ‘achievement context’, for example, many researchers believe that the colour red initiates avoidance behaviours through low-level physiological priming mechanisms. The neural correlates of this avoidance behaviour were identified in the Elliot et al. work1 using electroencephalography (EEG). Conversely, several researchers have proposed that, in an achievement context, the colour blue initiates approach behaviours2.Maier, Elliot & Lichtenfeld5 proposed that approach/avoidance behaviours can also be presented within a global/local processing framework. Specifically, it has been suggested that the colour red initiates a focusing or constricting of the attentional spotlight that facilitates the processing of local features while, the colour blue has the opposite effect, encouraging ‘big picture’ or ‘global’ feature processing.The concepts of local and global processing are not defined rigorously in the context of the high-level cognitive tasks commonly used in the literature. In this paper, we examine claims of chromatically-cued task performance using a classic low-level visual paradigm that contains both local and global features. In all experiments, the nature of the psychophysical stimulus was constant and we examined the effect of ancillary chromatic features in a simple two-by-two factorial design. Specifically, we varied the colour of the fixation cross, instructions and target boundaries. We then examined the effects of these changes on performance in one of two tasks: global or local feature detection. Subjects were placed in an achievement context by encouraging a sense of competitiveness and instructing them that ‘success’ on the task would lead to further opportunities for (paid) research participation.Despite the use of strong chromatic cues and an achievement context, we found no effect of cue colour on performance. Specifically, neither global nor local feature detection thresholds showed any dependence on cue colour. We also examined the effect of cue colour on learning rates and, similarly, found no effect. We discuss these findings with reference to both low-level visual processing and the CIC theory.","22 Apr 2014","Approved","Arnold Wilkins, Department of Psychology, University of Essex, UK",NA," In the investigation of the effects of colour on behaviour, as in the investigation of hypnosis, it is difficult to separate from other effects the influence of participants’ prior beliefs and expectations. These are culturally determined, and may play a role in influencing outcomes. Within contemporary culture there are widely held beliefs about the effects that colour may have on behaviour, and these have the potential to alter the participants’ motivation and attitudes towards any study involving colour. Attitudes and motivation are more likely to play a role in those cognitive tasks that have given rise to the Colour in Context theory, than in the low-level visual task used here in which performance is judged using two-alternative Psychophysics.The current study appears to have been carefully designed and conducted, but perhaps slightly less carefully reported. I would have liked to have seen the stimuli described in greater detail. For example:What were the chromaticities of the red and blue colours used? It is unclear what made it impossible to match the luminances. Was the positioning of the square such that the centre was at 5 degrees eccentricity, or was it the nearest margin that was at 5 degrees eccentricity? Was the “radius” of the square measured horizontally or diagonally? I do not see how the lifetime of the dipoles could have been 0.005ms. Even if this is a typo and the lifetime was 0.005s, I am still incredulous because the screen refresh rate was 100Hz, so the frame duration was 0.01s and this is twice the supposed duration of the dipoles!A t-test is not a dependant, even when it is a dependent t-test.I would have liked to have seen some discussion of the possible role of colour in affecting the accommodative lag to the visual stimuli on display. There is data in the literature that could have been used to argue that the effects of colour on image blur would have been negligible (about 0.07 dioptres, at maximum), and in the event any effects of accommodation were minimal because colour had no effect on visual performance of either local or global tasks.Given that about half the participants were aware of the colour manipulation and half were not, it might have been of interest to have separated the data for these two groups to see whether any effects of belief (“Colour in Context”) were more apparent in the group that had awareness. Indeed, in the literature on ""Colour in Context"", it would have been useful to have known what preconceptions regarding the effects of colour the participants brought to the tasks they were asked to perform.

Castor oil is composed of up to 90% ricinoleic acid that is stored in the developing endosperm of the castor plant (Ricinus communis) in the form of triacylglycerol (TAG). However, castor seeds also contain the deadly toxin ricin, as well as a 2S albumin that is a major allergen2,3. These proteins, as well as the poor agronomic characteristics of the plant, make castor unsuitable as a major crop. While United States farmers are reluctant to grow castor, the demand for castor oil is increasing. Currently, industrial demand for castor oil is met from plants grown and manually harvested in India, China, and Brazil. Therefore, it would be advantageous to produce ricinoleic acid in a suitable crop species, such as canola, soybean, or camelina that lack ricin and the 2S albumin and can be widely grown in the United States. Furthermore, the knowledge gained from studying the biosynthesis of HFA in transgenic plants could be used to explore the synthesis of other novel fatty acids, such as epoxy fatty acid or conjugated fatty acids, which are made through similar biosynthetic mechanisms that rely on catalysis by modified desaturase enzymes1.The castor fatty acid hydroxylase (RcFAH12) is a diiron, mixed-function oxidase responsible for the synthesis of ricinoleic acid from oleate (18:1) on phosphatidylcholine (PC) in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane4,5. The reaction mechanism requires transfer of two electrons from NADH through cytochrome b5 reductase (CBR1) and cytochrome b5 (Cb5) and then to the catalytic enzyme RcFAH12, which oxidizes 18:1 to 18:1-OH with the reduction of oxygen to water6,7.Repeated attempts to express a RcFAH12 cDNA in Arabidopsis under the control of seed-specific promoters have yielded a maximum of only 17% HFA in seed oil8,9. Ricinoleic acid has also been produced in tobacco but at a very low yield7. In Arabidopsis, ricinoleic acid can be further desaturated to densipolic acid (18:2-OH) or elongated to lesquerolic acid (20:1-OH) and auricolic acid (20:2-OH) by the fatty acid elongase FAE1 and associated enzymes8. To reduce the range of HFAs produced, we transformed RcFAH12 into the fae1 background10 under the control of the seed-specific phaseolin promoter11,12. One of the lines generated, CL37, has a total HFA accumulation (18:1-OH plus 18:2-OH) of 17–19%13 and has been chosen for experimental investigations aimed at increasing the accumulation of HFA in the seed oil.In CL37 plants, we assume that RcFAH12 relies on the endogenous Arabidopsis electron transfer components, but these may not interact as efficiently with the RcFAH12 protein as do the components of the castor electron transfer system. The Arabidopsis fatty acid desaturases FAD2 and FAD3, which convert 18:1 into linoleic acid (18:2) and 18:2 into a-linolenic acid (18:3), respectively, are also diiron proteins that require reductant from CBR1 and Cb514–17. Previously, we have shown that a hypomorphic mutation in the CBR1 gene (cbr1-1) led to an 85% decrease in HFA levels in RcFAH12 Arabidopsis seeds, but much smaller decreases in 18:3 and 18:215. We concluded that, in the cbr1-1 mutant, the very substantial decrease in HFA was caused by an inadequate supply of electrons reaching the hydroxylase via Cb5, demonstrating that the Arabidopsis cytochrome b5 electron supply was critical to the activity of RcFAH12. It is possible that the decreased accumulation of HFA is a result of poor interaction between heterologous RcFAH12 enzyme and the endogenous Arabidopsis Cb5 proteins. Furthermore, in a separate study, we have shown that the activity of a Tetrahymena thermophila desaturase expressed in yeast is limited by weak interaction with the endogenous yeast Cb5. Activity of this desaturase was increased nearly tenfold by coexpression with a T. thermophila Cb5 protein18. Together, these results suggest that productive protein-protein interactions within the endoplasmic-reticulum electron transport chain are critical to supporting hydroxylase and desaturase activities.To test the possibility that electron supply to the RcFAH12 enzyme may be a constraint on hydroxylase activity and accumulation of HFA in seeds of the CL37 line, we set out to identify castor genes encoding components of the endoplasmic reticulum electron transport chain and express them in the CL37 line, under control of seed-specific promoters. We tested three RcCb5 genes, and we also expressed each of these alongside the gene encoding castor cytochrome b5 reductase (RcCBR1). None of the gene combinations that we tested in a total of 270 independent transgenic lines provided any substantial increase in seed HFA content. Our results strongly indicate that electron supply is not limiting the activity of the RcFAH12 hydroxylase in these transgenic Arabidopsis lines.","17 Jan 2014","Approved","Mark Smith, National Research Council Canada, Canada","Author Response 07 Nov 2013"," I agree with the authors response to my comments, the evidence supports the conclusion that expression of genes encoding homologous electron transport components does not appear to be of value in this case.

Patients with neglect show difficulty in responding to or orienting towards objects and events that occur on the contralesional side of space1. Symptoms of neglect can be reduced following a brief period of a sensory-motor training technique called prism adaptation2. Patients who spend a few minutes pointing to visual targets while wearing prismatic glasses that shifted the visual image to the right demonstrate a leftward shift, or ‘adaptation’, in their pointing as well as improved performance on standard clinical tests such as target cancellation and line bisection. The benefits of prism adaptation have been observed in multiple sensory modalities: vision3, tactile detection4, haptic exploration5, pressure sensitivity and finger position sense6, and auditory processing7. Furthermore, prism adaptation results in improvements in tasks that have direct relevance for recovery of independence such as reading8,9, postural control10, and wheelchair navigation11,12. The broad generalisation of prism adaptation treatment has generated considerable interest in understanding the mechanisms by which the technique reduces symptoms.In healthy participants, adaptation to leftward-shifting prisms (producing a rightward reaching bias) temporarily induces neglect-like performance on tests of lateralised spatial attention such as a non-manual version of the line bisection test called the landmark test13–17. Although the changes shown by healthy participants are generally smaller in magnitude than those shown by neglect patients, they too have been observed in multiple sensory modalities14,16–19. Interestingly, Michel and colleagues13 showed that the magnitude of midpoint shift increased with more leftward line placement and longer line length, replicating the so-called ‘position’ and ‘length’ effects that have been described in neglect patients. Therefore, although adaptation to rightward-shifting prisms can reduce symptoms in neglect patients by shifting the response bias towards the left side of space, adaptation to leftward-shifting prisms can induce a similar but opposite change in healthy participant, inducing a small rightward response bias. The similarity in the effects of prism adaptation on the performance of neglect patients and healthy controls makes it possible to gain insights into the potential therapeutic effects of the technique through experiments on healthy volunteers.The primary motivation of the present study was to investigate whether prism adaptation can alter object-based attention: that is, the extent to which object boundaries influence the allocation and redirection of selective attention. Considerable research provides support for the existence of object-based attention mechanisms that are distinct from a purely spatially-based allocation of attention in which object boundaries are irrelevant20–22. A particularly compelling demonstration of object-based attention was provided by Egly, Driver and Rafal23. In their task (the ‘Egly task’), two rectangles were arranged horizontally or vertically on either side of a central fixation cross. Targets appeared at one end of one rectangle. The targets were preceded by a cue in either the same location (validly-cued) or a different location (invalidly-cued) to the target. Critically, for invalidly-cued trials the cue location was either at the same end of the adjacent rectangle as the target (requiring a between-object shift of attention), or in the opposite end of the same rectangle as the target (requiring a within-object shift of attention). By setting the length of the rectangles to be equidistant to the distance separating the rectangles, the authors ensured that any difference in reaction times (RT) for the two invalidly-cued conditions could only be attributed to object-based attention mechanisms (because the spatial separation of the cue and target locations was the same across conditions). Larger RT costs were found for the between-object condition than for the within-object condition, providing evidence for object-based attention.In neglect patients, symptoms can manifest in both space- and object-based frames of reference. For example, a neglect patient may fail to copy all objects on the left side of a page (space-based neglect), or may fail to copy the left half of every object in the scene regardless of where they appear on the page (object-based neglect). Although patients often demonstrate a combination of space- and object-based neglect, the two are considered to be separable and have partially distinct neurological bases24,25. The broad generalisation of benefits induced by prism adaptation suggests that the therapy can influence core aspects of neglect symptoms. However, although several studies suggest that prism adaptation can alter space-based orienting in neglect patients26–29 and healthy participants14–16, there is relatively little evidence that prism adaptation would have equal efficacy in treating patients whose deficits are primarily object-based.Some insights into whether prism adaptation can influence object-based attention were provided by Schindler and colleagues30. Healthy participants, right-hemisphere lesioned patients without neglect, and right-hemisphere patients with neglect completed the Egly task before and after adaptation to rightward-shifting prisms. Their task had a similar format to the original Egly task, in that there were two rectangles presented either vertically or horizontally, and these were positioned one on each side of a central fixation cross. Compared to the two control groups, the neglect patients were significantly worse at shifting their attention from one object in the ipsilesional field to another in the contralesional visual field, and this deficit was abolished by prism adaptation. This finding suggests that prism adaptation can influence object-based attention. However there are still some outstanding questions regarding both object-based attention and how it is influenced by prism adaptation. First, for healthy participants adaptation to leftward-shifting prisms can alter cognitive performance, however adaptation to rightward-shifting prisms generally has no such effect (although see Berberovic and Mattingley19 for an exception). Because Schindler and colleagues only tested adaptation to rightward-shifting prisms, it is not yet known whether prism adaptation can induce neglect-like changes in object-based attention in healthy participants. Second, the object-based deficit reported by Schindler and colleagues is potentially confounded by the requirement to shift attention between the two visual fields. Neglect patients were slower at shifting their attention between-objects only when it required a shift of attention from the ipsilesional to contralesional field: the RTs of neglect patients were normal for between-object shifts vertically within a visual field, and for horizontal within-object shifts from the ipsilesional to contralesional field. It is therefore unclear whether the pattern shown by their neglect patients at baseline can be attributed to a general deficit in shifting attention horizontally between two objects, or to a more specific deficit in shifting attention between two objects that are presented in different visual hemifields. By extension, it is unclear whether the improvements observed following prism adaptation were driven by a change in object-based attention, or an improvement in inter-hemisphere signalling.In the present study we examine the effect of prism adaptation on space- and object-based attention in healthy participants using an adapted version of the Egly paradigm31 in which all shifts of attention were restricted within one of the two visual fields (see Figure 2). Four rectangles (two in each visual field) were presented either horizontally or vertically in each trial. Cues and targets for each trial appeared in the same visual field according to three conditions (validly-cued, within-object shift and between-object shift). In a between-group design, participants completed blocks of the Egly task after adaptation to leftward- or rightward-shifting prisms, or neutral pointing.Using this four-rectangle version of the Egly paradigm we examined the effect of prism adaptation on three aspects of attention that are known to be altered in hemispatial neglect. First, we examined the effect of prism adaptation on object-based attention by comparing reaction times for validly-cued trials, within-object trials and between-object trials in each visual field across the three participant groups.Second, we examined the effect of prism adaptation on the tonic distribution of attention across the visual field. Kinsbourne32 argued that the distribution of visuo-spatial attention across space is determined by two opposing gradients controlled by the contralateral cerebral hemispheres. One possible way that prism adaptation influences attention is by altering the balance between these opposing gradients: i.e., by rebalancing the hemispheric competition in patients and unbalancing the hemispheric competition in healthy controls. If this is the case, then adaptation to leftward-shifting prisms would induce a neglect-like gradient of attention in healthy participants, with lowest attention (highest RTs) to the left-most part of the visual field, and highest attention (lowest RTs) to the right-most part of the visual field.Finally, we examined the effect of prism adaptation on horizontal shifts of attention. Patients with neglect are impaired at shifting their attention in a contralesional direction (the ‘disengage deficit’33). There is some evidence that prism adaptation can reduce the disengage deficit in neglect patients28,34 and can alter reaction times for horizontal shifts of attention in healthy participants35, although there are some inconsistencies in the effects that have been observed for different cue types across these studies. We predicted that adaptation to leftward-shifting prisms would result in a neglect-like deficit in shifting attention leftward. This neglect-like deficit may be restricted to between-object shifts of attention, in keeping with the findings of Schindler and colleagues30.","07 Mar 2014","Approved","Igor Schindler, Department of Psychology, University of Hull, UK","Author Response 21 Dec 2013"," GeneralThis is a well designed study using appropriate methods. The authors demonstrate convincingly that prism adaptation does not impact on either within or between object attention shifts. The introduction is, overall, scholarly and concise and the discussion provides a comprehensive explanation of the findings by arguing that a biased normal baseline performance is a pre-requisite for observing significant changes in attention biases following prism adaptation. I only have a few very minor suggestions/comments the authors may want to consider:IntroductionAs Radek Ptak pointed out not all studies using prism adaptation in neglect yielded positive results.I agree regarding the inclusion of conflicting results but it is clear that the methods used varied between studies such as the extent to which the hand/arm was seen by the subject during pointing (full view of the arm vs. view of the finger only during adaptation). In addition, the type of prisms used varied across studies i.e. some used Fresnel prisms that do not provide a seamless shift of the visual field whereas others used prisms that fused magnifying lenses with prism lenses providing a seamless visual percept.Finally, the nature of brain damage itself may account for some patients showing larger prismatic after-effects than others. A recent fMRI study by Luauté et al. (2009) in healthy participants indicated increased activation of inferior parietal areas during the early stage of error detection and correction and temporal areas during the later stage of sensory realignment. Thus the combination of different prisms, adaptation protocols and lesion location/extent as well as lesion age might contribute in part to these conflicting findings.ResultsOn page 7 it is stated that the mean accuracy was 85% which could be further specified by including the accuracy range across adaptation groups to provide information on whether the accuracy levels were comparable.Also one interesting finding is that the neutral group seems to show faster reaction times compared to both prism groups irrespective of target location in the visual field. It would be useful to evaluate whether the two prism groups (pooled) showed overall higher reaction times than the neutral group as suggested by Radek Ptak but also whether the increase in reaction times was paralleled by a change in accuracy. If this is the case, it would suggest a perturbing overall impact of prism adaptation in healthy participants in the Egly task. This would potentially strengthen the argument of non–beneficial effects of prism adaptation in tasks that elicit unbiased performance in healthy participants. I have read this submission.

Because they are unique for each individual and are strongly influenced by genetics, they also perform a significant role in anthropology, human genetics, ethnology and medicine. They are characterized by alternating strips of raised friction ridges and grooves present in a variety of patterns2. These patterns start to develop between the 5th and 6th week of intrauterine life, and are fully formed by the 21st week3. These patterns do not change throughout postnatal life and their development is determined by several genes4.Handedness (i.e. hand dominance) is defined as the uneven distribution of fine motor skills between the left and right hand5. Determination of the handedness of both the assailant and the victim are important in various aspects of forensic science, including personal identification6. Hence, establishing the relationship between handedness and digital dermatoglyphics will aid forensic identification.To date, scarce amount of studies7–13 have investigated whether there is a correlation between handedness and digital dermatoglyphics. In 1940 Cummins discovered a slight association in the sex differences of asymmetrical occurrence of dermatoglyphic patterns8. Cromwell and Rife in 1942 found that left-handers are characterized by slightly less bimanual asymmetry than right-handers among on Caucasian school children in southwestern Ohio9. In 1943 Rife found associations characteristic of autosomal linkage between the whorl frequencies on the fingers and handedness among descended from northern European stock10. In 1994 Coren reported an increased number of arches, fewer whorls in left-handers as compared to the right-handers among Canadians11.

In breast cancer patients, MMP-1 expression has been correlated to primary tumor progression, metastatic potential, and survival2–6. Further, in glioblastoma, melanoma and breast cancer, higher incidence has been associated with a single nucleotide polymorphism in an Ets-binding site which increases MMP-1 expression7,8.Outside the clinic, MMP-1 expression has been measured in a variety of breast cancer cell lines. In general, its expression is greater in cells with higher metastatic potential (e.g. MDA-MB-231) when compared to cells of low metastatic potential (e.g. MCF-7)9–11. Similarly, MDA-MB-231 cell variants with different metastatic potentials demonstrate the correlation between MMP-1 expression and metastasis12–14.MMP-1 regulation has been well studied in HeLa and other cell culture systems15. However, less is known about how MMP-1 is regulated in metastasis. Recent studies have identified several promoter regions and factors that may play a role in MMP-1 regulation. For example, in melanoma cells, Twist binding to the MMP-1 promoter was found to increase expression of MMP-116. In MCF-7 cells, HER2, which is upregulated in 15% – 25% of breast tumors and associated with poor prognosis, was found to upregulate MMP-1 through the ERK1/2 pathway17.The AP-1 consensus site is the archetype for tumor associated gene expression. It was discovered in the MMP-1 promoter as being activated by tumor promoting phorbol esters18,19. Since its discovery, the role of AP-1 in tumorigenesis has been further substantiated20. Tissue immunohistochemistry revealed that expression of Fra-1, an AP-1 family member, correlates with breast cancer malignancy21,22.To study the altered regulation of gene expression in metastatic breast cancer cells, we have utilized a series of MDA-MB-231 breast adenocarcinoma cell variants developed by the Massague lab12,14. MDA-MB-231 cells, which were derived from a pleural effusion of a breast cancer patient with relapsed disease, cause a low level of metastasis when injected into immunocompromised mice by various routes. Metastatic cells from these xenografts had greater metastatic potential when subsequently cultured and reinjected into mice. These cells derived from metastatic tumors in secondary organs (e.g. lung and bone) also showed greater organ-specificity. Alternatively, MDA-MB-231 cells were single cell cloned. These propagated single cell populations (Scp cell lines) had varied metastatic potential. Analysis of genomic expression using microarrays on these cell lines of varying metastatic potential provided us with an opportunity to identify genes correlated with metastatic potential12–14. In addition, these cell lines provided us with a well controlled system to understand the mechanism of how gene expression is altered in highly metastatic cells.The gene whose expression was most strongly increased in the highly metastatic cell variants was MMP-1. In this study we have compared the expression of MMP-1 in the high and low metastatic MDA-MB-231 variants and present evidence for the role of an AP-1 site in the MMP-1 promoter and the translational regulation of the AP-1 family member Fra-1.","22 Apr 2014","Approved","Danny N Dhanasekaran, OU Cancer Institute, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, USA",NA," This is a well-designed study with solid data to support the claim that Fra-1 regulated MMP-1 is involved in the metastatic phenotype of a variant cell line derived from MDA-MB-231 cells.  The study is carried out with well-controlled experiments.  The authors have nicely presented their voluminous data with a very succinct discussion.

Over the past decades, however, it has become apparent that males also express mating preferences3,6–12, especially if females show pronounced differences in mate quality (e.g., through size–fecundity relationships13). Nonetheless, male reproductive biology is clearly influenced by competition over mates1,14–16, and, at least in species in which females tend to mate with multiple males, this competition extends well into the period after a successful copulation, as sperm of several males can compete for fertilization of the female’s ova17–19. However, the level of male competition, male mate choice and behavioral responses to perceived sperm competition risk (SCR), may vary between taxa20–22. An interesting group to study interspecific variation in male aggressive and reproductive behavior is the family Poeciliidae (livebearing fishes), which comprises at least 260 species23. Several members of this family are model organisms for a range of topics in behavior, ecology and evolution24. Nonetheless, comparative approaches in this group mostly considered morphological or physiological traits25,26, while comparisons of behavioral traits are usually limited to population-level differences (guppy, Poecilia reticulata:27), or to a few species commonly used in scientific laboratories28,29 for exceptions see Dugatkin et al.30, and Westneat et al.31. Our present study compared ten different species (13 populations) of poeciliid fishes and thus, provides comprehensive insights into potential interspecific variation in male aggressive and reproductive behavior within the family Poeciliidae. Beside aggressiveness and sexual activity, we particularly focused on the presumed role SCR plays for males of this family22.Theory predicts that males should adjust their mating behavior strategically to imminent SCR19,32, and several studies on species exhibiting frequent multiple mating confirm that perceived SCR affects male mate choice behavior10,11,18,33–35. In the Atlantic molly, Poecilia mexicana, for instance, males temporarily decrease their sexual activity and cease showing mating preferences when another male is eavesdropping9,18,21,36,37. It has been hypothesized that those audience-induced changes in male mating behavior prevent rivals from copying mate choice decisions19,32. Moreover, males initially interact more with a previously non-preferred female in the presence of a rival, which has again been interpreted in the context of mate choice copying — and ultimately, SCR — as males could thus lead the copying male away from the preferred mate (“deceptive mating behavior”;21,36,38).Theoretical considerations identify avoidance of aggressive interactions as another potential mechanism explaining audience-induced changes in male mating behavior32. Specifically, if different males share intrinsic mating preferences (e.g., for large female body size8,21), males could interact more equally with different females to reduce the risk of injuries resulting from aggressive interactions over commonly preferred female phenotypes32. If avoiding aggression plays a role, then the magnitude of audience-induced changes in male mating behavior (at the species level) should correlate positively with mean aggressiveness. To test this hypothesis, we examined the intensity of aggressive interactions in size-matched dyadic (paired) male combats for the set of poeciliid species included herein and in an independent approach quantified audience-induced changes of male mate choice in response to an audience (see above) for the same taxa.Consistency in the expression of a certain behavioral type across different environmental contexts at the inter-individual level has received considerable scientific interest39–42, and suites of correlated behavioral types have been termed behavioral syndromes39,43. Réale et al.44 proposed five different axes of animal personality: shyness–boldness, exploration–avoidance, general activity, aggressiveness, and sociability. Conrad et al.43 highlighted several correlations of those behavioral axes in teleost fishes, but audience-induced changes in male mating behavior have not yet been investigated in the context of behavioral syndromes. Recent studies exemplified the importance of population differences in behavioral syndromes45,46, and the concept of behavioral syndromes was expanded to the comparison of groups of animals or populations. Chapman et al.47, for example, demonstrated correlations between mean colony (and caste) behavioral types in Myrmica ants. Here, we apply this concept to the comparison of different poeciliid taxa, thus evaluating species-specific behavioral types.In summary, we assembled a unique data-set comprising ten different poeciliid species (in some cases, several sub-species or ecotypes, or multiple populations) and sought for variation at the taxon level (“species-specific behavioral types”) in (1) audience-induced changes in male mate choice, (2) deceptive male mating behavior, (3) sexual activity (previously published, re-analyzed own data, see Table 1), and (4) aggressiveness (newly generated data as well as previously published own data, Table 1). We tested for correlations of these behavioral tendencies, i.e., we asked whether there are behavioral syndromes at the taxon level.Table 1.

Replicative life span is defined as the number of daughter cells that a mother cell can produce prior to entering an irreversible cell cycle arrest, while chronological lifespan is defined as the length of time that a yeast cell can maintain viability in a non-dividing state2,3. Numerous genetic and environmental factors have been identified that can modulate either replicative aging, or chronological aging, or both.Replicative aging has been studied almost exclusively by maintaining individual cells on the surface of a nutrient agar plate, microdissecting daughter cells away from the mother cells, and counting the number of daughter cells that the mother cell produces prior to senescence4. Generally, rich YPD medium (2% glucose) is used for replicative lifespan assays. Calorie restriction by reducing the glucose concentration of the medium to 0.5% or lower has been shown in numerous studies to extend lifespan in different wild type strain backgrounds between 10–40%5,6.Several methods have been described for studying chronological aging. The most widely utilized protocol involves culturing yeast cells in synthetic complete liquid medium with 2% glucose as the carbon source, either under shaking or static conditions, in culture tubes or 96-well plates7,8. Alternative, but less frequently used, liquid culture methods for chronological aging involve culturing cells in rich YPD medium, using a respiratory carbon source such as glycerol, or transferring cells to water once they have reached stationary phase growth arrest9,10. A plate-based assay for chronological life span analysis has also been described in which cells are growth arrested through limitation for tryptophan11. In all of these assays, viability over time is determined by restoring a small subset of the population to nutrient rich growth conditions and assaying their ability to re-enter the cell cycle, either through quantification of colony forming units on solid-agar plates or through outgrowth kinetics in liquid culture3,12. Similar to the case for replicative lifespan, calorie restriction by reducing the initial glucose concentration of the culture medium can extend chronological lifespan, generally by more than 100%13,14.One important feature of the standard method for determining chronological aging is that the culture medium becomes acidified over the first few days of the experiment, with pH dropping from an initial value of around 4.0 to 2.5–2.9 within 96 hours15. This acidification of the external environment results from the production of organic acids, including acetic acid, following fermentation of glucose to ethanol and subsequent utilization of ethanol as a carbon source once the glucose is depleted. Preventing medium acidification by buffering the culture to a pH of 6.0 with either citrate phosphate buffer or low salt MES buffer results in a more than doubling of chronological lifespan15. Calorie restriction, or switching the yeast culture to a non-fermentable carbon source, such as glycerol or ethanol, also prevents acidification and results in a similar magnitude of chronological lifespan extension as buffering15,16.Although the two yeast aging assays are nearly always studied independently, it is clear that they share at least some overlap. As mentioned above, calorie restriction extends both replicative and chronological lifespan, as do a few genetic interventions, such as deletion of either TOR1 or SCH9, both of which are nutrient-responsive kinases7,17–19. In addition, it has been shown that chronologically aged cells have reduced replicative lifespan when returned to rich growth conditions9. This reduction in replicative lifespan following chronological aging appears to be mediated through changes in mitochondrial function, since the chronologically old cells that retain the lowest mitochondrial membrane potential also have the longest replicative lifespan following resumption of cell division20. Calorie restriction or buffering the culture medium of the cells during chronological aging also protects against subsequent replicative lifespan reduction21, raising the possibility that medium acidification directly influences both types of yeast aging. To assess this possibility, we performed replicative lifespan analysis on wild type BY4742 mother cells under either standard conditions or on rich media buffered to different pH values. We were unable to detect a significant replicative lifespan extension from buffering the culture medium under any of the conditions examined, including those conditions that robustly extend chronological lifespan.","03 Dec 2013","Approved","Cory Dunn, Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Koç University, Turkey",NA," In this work, Wasko et al. investigate whether altering the pH of rich medium can result in changes to the replicative lifespan of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain BY4742. They find that replicative lifespan, except in the most extreme case of pH 9.0, is not affected by extracellular pH. Their results indicate that mutations and conditions increasing replicative lifespan are unlikely to do so through altering acidity/alkalinity of rich medium.Recently, it was demonstrated by Hughes et al. Nature 492:261-265 that deletion of the vacuolar V1VO-ATPase subunit Vma2p, which results in an increased vacuolar pH, causes a drastic shortening of replicative lifespan. Also, Hughes et al. found, by a qualitative microscopy assay, that over expression of VMA1 or VPH2 decreased vacuolar pH and that replicative lifespan was coincidentally increased.Extracellular pH has been demonstrated to impinge on vacuolar pH, more prominently in the case of increased medium pH. This has been examined most comprehensively by Brett et al. PLoS ONE 6(3):e17619, but has also been demonstrated by others using genetic, fluorophore-based, and even 31P-NMR-based assays. If extracellular pH impinges upon vacuolar pH, and if replicative lifespan depends upon vacuolar pH, then why is replicative lifespan not changed upon altering extracellular pH?

A diagnosis of neglect is a strong predictor of poor functional outcome and low independence following stroke2. This may be partly because the disorder impairs perception in a broad range of sensory modalities ranging from vision, touch, proprioception, and motor control to more abstract aspects of cognition such as a patient’s awareness of their own body3 and their imagined images of familiar locations4. Furthermore, although the rightward spatial bias is the defining symptom of neglect, several other processing disturbances are associated with the disorder. These include low general arousal5, poor sustained attention6, and difficulties in keeping track of spatial locations as they move about their environment7. These non-lateralised spatial biases are thought to increase neglect severity and reduce the potential for recovery8.Over the last fifteen years a promising behavioural intervention for neglect has emerged in the form of a sensorimotor training technique called prism adaptation9. During prism adaptation, patients reach for objects viewed through rightward-deflecting prisms, leading to a leftward recalibration of reaching movements that can be measured as leftward errors once the prisms are removed. In patients with neglect this leftward recalibration of reaching is accompanied by a reduction in their symptoms. A single five-minute session of prism adaptation is sufficient to improve the performance of neglect patients on tests of visuo-motor function such as copying, cancellation and reading9,10. These effects extend to non-visual spatial processing, such as tactile perception11 and manual exploration of space while blindfolded12, and to complex mental operations such as the exploration of an internally generated map of France13; and 'bisection' of numbers14. Evidence amassed over a number of studies suggests that this simple behavioural intervention can have broadly generalised effects, and prism adaptation is considered to be a highly promising potential treatment for neglect15.Whereas adaptation to rightward-shifting prisms can reduce neglect symptoms in brain-lesioned patients, adaptation to leftward-shifting prisms, involving a rightward recalibration of reaching, leads to neglect-like changes in the spatial performance of healthy participants. These perceptual changes have been demonstrated on a similar range of visual, non-visual and mental tasks (albeit to a lesser extent than those changes observed in patients)17–19. Since prism adaptation can be used to induce similar, but opposite, changes in the performance of healthy participants as in neglect patients, it is possible to gain insights into the potential therapeutic effects of the technique by testing healthy volunteers.One example of research from healthy participants that has complemented the understanding gained from studies in patients is in research examining the effects of prism adaptation on non-lateralised deficits. There are now several pieces of evidence from brain-lesioned patients that prism adaptation alters spatial processing deficits that cannot be described in terms of orienting to the left versus the right, including reductions in spatial dysgraphia20 and shifts21 and reductions in perseveration22. We previously demonstrated that adaptation to rightward-shifting prisms reverses the tendency of patients with right hemisphere lesions to become fixated on local details of a scene in preference to the global configuration (the ‘local processing bias’)23. Patients identified the local or global level of large letters that were built from smaller letters (‘Navon’ figures). Reaction times to the local level increased after prism adaptation, demonstrating that there was a reduction in patients’ ability to identify the local level without interference from conflicting information at the global level. Conversely, RTs to the global level decreased following prism adaptation, demonstrating that patients were better able to ignore irrelevant conflicting information from the local level. In a similar experiment with healthy participants we demonstrated that adaptation to leftward-shifting prisms temporarily increased local processing24, and led to neglect-like errors in the way in which a spatial representation or ‘map’ of the environment is updated as we move our gaze around it25. Together these results demonstrate that prism adaptation has a more pervasive influence on visual perception than merely shifting attention to one side.To further test the extent of this influence, the present study examines the effect of prism adaptation on the perception of composite faces in healthy participants. Faces, perhaps more than any other object, undergo automatic global-level processing in which individual components are highly integrated and less available to independent evaluation. This is powerfully illustrated in the composite face illusion (Figure 1): when the upper and lower halves of two faces are recombined, the virtually unavoidable illusion is that one is viewing the face of a third, different person. When participants are asked to identify the top or bottom halves of composites that are formed from faces of well-known celebrities, they are slower compared to when performing the same task when the two face halves are offset26. This reaction time cost demonstrates that even when processing a face as an integrated Gestalt would impair our ability to perform the task at hand, we are unable to suppress such configural processing.Figure 1. Examples of the four stimulus types (adapted from Weston and Perfect30).Stimuli for the task used in the present study took the same form as these examples, but were created from black-and-white publicity photographs of two well-known movie stars (Brad Pitt and George Clooney).We had two main reasons for testing the influence of prism adaptation on configural face perception. First, by using a stimulus type for which normal processing is known to be strongly biased towards global processing, we reasoned that we could gain insight into the pervasiveness of the influence of prism adaptation on perceptual processes. Second, this experiment explores the possibility that prism adaptation could be used to improve face processing in individuals with prosopagnosia and autism, who have been shown to have reduced or absent configural face processing27,28. We predicted that adaptation to leftward-shifting prisms, which induced neglect-like processing in healthy participants, would reduce the RT cost associated with identifying composite faces. We further predicted that there would be no change in composite face processing following adaptation to rightward-shifting prisms, which does not induce perceptual changes in healthy participants.","06 May 2014","Approved","Wolfgang Heide, Department of Neurology, General Hospital Celle, Germany",NA," Bultitude and colleagues performed a psychophysical study on the perception/recognition time of composite faces before and after prism adaptation, in 64 healthy young women. Faces were composed of top and bottom halves from either the same or 2 different familiar persons. The authors demonstrate that adaptation to leftward-shifting prisms does not significantly change change the extent to which the irrelevant face half interfered with processing. Consequently, they conclude that prism adaptation does not have a significant effect on ventral stream processing of perceptual features, but appears to affect exclusively dorsal stream processing. The study results are straightforward and the discussion is appropriate. Only I propose that the authors might add some comments and discussion on their finding that rightward-shifting prisms did lead to some significant reduction of reaction time costs.  I have read this submission.

Malignant melanoma has a poor prognosis with a 5-year survival rate of only 15%3. The recently approved therapeutic, vemurafenib, extends median patient survival by 7 months4–6. This major advance raises expectations that even greater rates of survival might be attainable with combination therapies.Activation of the Wnt/ß-catenin pathway decreases tumor growth and cooperates with ERK/MAPK pathway inhibitors to promote apoptosis in melanoma1,6–12. Analysis of melanoma tumor samples show a positive correlation between nuclear ß-catenin staining and decreased tumor depth, increased patient survival and increased time to metastasis1,7–9. Moreover, treatment with WNT3A-containing conditioned media or stable overexpression of WNT3A in mouse B16 or human A375 melanoma cells reduces cell number in vitro9–11. Allografts of mouse B16 or mouse xenografts of human A375 cells overexpressing WNT3A decrease tumor size compared to control9,11. Recently, we found that activation of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling concurrent with the inhibition of the ERK/MAPK pathway synergistically elevates apoptosis in a subset of BRAF- and NRAS-mutant cultured human melanoma cells11,12. Given the interaction between Wnt/ß-catenin signaling and pathways known to be critical for melanoma pathogenesis, the identification of Wnt/ß-catenin regulators might prove to be informative in developing novel approaches to treat this disease.In the present study, we identify novel regulators of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling in melanoma by performing a large-scale small-interfering RNA (siRNA) screen of a Wnt/ß-catenin responsive reporter in human HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells, and by identifying siRNA targets that are also regulated by ERK/MAPK signaling and that have been previously associated with melanoma. By integrating these three approaches, we identified FAM129B as a potential regulator of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling. FAM129B is a 746 amino acid protein that contains an amino-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and a differentially phosphorylated carboxy-terminal region13. FAM129B is known to inhibit TNFa-dependent apoptosis in HeLa cells14. FAM129B is expressed in melanoma and promotes tumor cell invasion into collagen matrices in an ERK/MAPK phosphorylation-dependent manner13. In the present study we demonstrate that FAM129B promotes Wnt/ß-catenin signal transduction in melanoma cells and that reducing levels of FAM129B with siRNA reduces the ability of WNT3A to increase apoptosis in melanoma cells.","31 Oct 2013","Approved","Madelon Maurice, Department of Cell Biology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Netherlands","Author Response 10 Oct 2013"," I am satisfied with the changes made by the author(s).

Tics are repetitive, stereotyped, suppressible movements or vocalizations that may include blinking, abdominal tensing, sniffing, or throat clearing3. TS affects approximately 0.5% of school-age children, but its causes and pathophysiology are not yet well understood4.It has been suggested that problems with activity modulation in the basal ganglia and thalamus may contribute to the inability of TS patients to exercise behavioral inhibition5,6 as a result of these structures’ effects on behavioral inhibition via the prefrontal, parietal, temporal, and cingulate cortices7. The basal ganglia and thalamus modulate cortical activity through cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loops, composed of connections from the frontal cortex to the striatum, the striatum to the globus pallidus, substantia nigra, and thalamus, and the thalamus back to the cortex8.Several lines of evidence support the presence of structural abnormalities in basal ganglia nuclei in individuals with TS4. Autopsy studies have found abnormalities within the basal ganglia, including increased number of neurons in the globus pallidus interna, decreased density and number of neurons in the globus pallidus pars externa, and decreased parvalbumin and choline acetyltransferase staining cholinergic interneurons in the caudate nucleus and putamen9,10. However, since TS is rarely a fatal disease, the number of autopsied cases is limited11. Case studies of focal brain lesions have demonstrated new tic onset after lesions to the prefrontal cortex, thalamus, and basal ganglia12. In addition, encephalitis lethargica, frontal lobe degeneration, Huntington disease, Wilson disease, and other degenerative illnesses are associated with tics12. Further, some TS patients have benefitted from deep brain stimulation of the globus pallidus and thalamus in TS13–16. Collectively, these observations suggest a role for the basal ganglia, thalamus, and frontal cortex in tics.Neuroimaging studies can be especially beneficial for studying structural abnormalities because they allow longitudinal study design, reduced investigator and sampling bias, and are relatively non-invasive. A number of MRI studies have examined anatomical volumes and cortical thickness in children and adults with TS and reported significant differences in various brain regions, including the caudate, sensorimotor and prefrontal cortex, and corpus callosum17. Most consistently, basal ganglia volumes were found to be smaller in TS subjects compared with healthy controls, but neuroanatomical shape differences and asymmetry abnormalities have not yet been consistently described18–24.Large-deformation high dimensional brain mapping (HDBM-LD) is a computational anatomy tool that reduces the potential for human error in image analysis by further automating elements of image analysis. It has been successfully employed in characterizing shape and volume abnormalities of the hippocampus in neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia25–27, dementia of the Alzheimer type28–31, depression32 and epilepsy33. It has also been applied to examine the thalamus in schizophrenia34.HDBM-LD was applied to assess volume and shape differences in putamen, caudate nucleus, nucleus accumbens, globus pallidus, and thalamus in 15 adults with TS and 15 matched controls. No differences in volume or shape were found35. However, TS begins before adulthood. Several structural imaging studies in TS have found an interaction between regional brain volumes and age21,22. It has been suggested that differences seen in adult studies may reflect adaptations or selection bias rather than changes etiologically relevant to TS20. Thus the present study applied HDBM-LD to investigate the volume and shape of these structures in children. We hypothesized that we would find reduced volume, abnormal shape, or abnormal right-to-left asymmetry in one or more of these structures, compared to age-matched controls. Given that there were no prior studies using the HDBM-LD method to analyze brain structures of children with TS in the literature, another goal of this pilot study was to estimate the effect size of these measures in this population.","27 Mar 2014","Approved","Kirsten R Müller-Vahl, Clinic of Psychiatry, Social psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Hannover Medical School, Germany","Author Response 27 Mar 2014"," In this study a relatively new and sophisticated method (using large-deformation, high dimensional brain mapping (HDBM-LD)) has been used to investigate for the first time structure geometry and volume of basal ganglia and thalamus in 13 children with Tourette syndrome (TS) compared to 16 healthy controls. Comparable to a prior study in adults with TS performed by the same group, no significant differences could be detected in volume, shape, or right/left asymmetry. These findings are in contrast to several other studies suggesting a reduction of the volume of the caudate in both children and adults with TS. The major limitation of this study is the small sample size and the heterogeneity of the patients’ group with respect to comorbidities and medication. In particular, medication with neuroleptic drugs might have influenced the results, since there is evidence that exposure to antipsychotic medication may cause basal ganglia enlargement. However, the study has also several strengths including the well experienced team of researchers, low age range and inclusion of children only, and excellent matching for age, sex, and handedness. I enjoyed reading the discussion, because results obtained in children were not mixed with those in adults. The introduction would benefit from a more precise clinical description. For example: tics are no longer characterized as “stereotyped” movements, abdominal tension is an untypical example for a motor tic, and tics “may” be associated with other disorders such as Wilson’s and Huntington’s disease. The title and abstract are appropriate. Although this study contributes to our understanding of the neurobiology of TS, comparable to most MRI studies in TS, it is limited by the small sample size and possible influences of medication and comorbidities. I would love to read the results of a follow-up study including a larger number of patients soon. I have read this submission.

Glucocorticoids bind to the glucocorticoid receptor to reduce the expression of genes that produce a variety of pro-inflammatory mediators and mucus in the lung4–6. The most commonly prescribed glucocorticoids are beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP), triamcinolone acetonide (TCL), budesonide (BUD), fluticasone propionate (FLT), and flunisolide (FLN)1. BDP is a pro-drug and requires removal of the C-21 propionate group to become pharmacologically active; the active drug is beclomethasone 17-monopropionate, referred to as [M1] (Figure 1)7. Pharmacological inactivation and clearance of glucocorticoids, such as BDP and its active metabolite [M1], is mediated, in part, by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes (Figure 1).Figure 1. Metabolic scheme for the production of [M1] (the active form of the drug) by esterase enzymes and [M5] by CYP3A enzymes.In humans, CYP3A4, 3A5, and 3A7 are the primary CYP enzymes involved in glucocorticoid metabolism8–11. CYP3A4 is the most abundant CYP3A enzyme in the liver and intestines8,12,13, CYP3A5 is more prevalent in the lung than the liver12,14–16, and CYP3A7 is expressed in fetal liver, but diminishes after birth when CYP3A4 becomes the dominant adult hepatic CYP3A enzyme17,18. Expression of CYP3A7 in fetal and adult respiratory tissue has also been observed16.Regulation of CYP3A enzymes in response to glucocorticoid treatment has been extensively characterized in the liver, but less is known about this phenomenon in the lung. In hepatocytes, CYP3A enzyme induction is mediated by the pregnane X receptor (PXR)19,20 (Figure 2A). However, PXR is not expressed in the lung21. Glucocorticoids can also influence CYP3A induction via the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) in the liver22,23. Briefly, glucocorticoids bind GR in the cytosol, which forms a homodimer and translocates into the nucleus, leading to increased transcription of CAR. CAR forms a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRa), which binds to the RXR-response element and induces the expression of CYP3A enzymes (Figure 2A)22. Previous work by Hukannen et al. demonstrated that CAR was not expressed in A549 (adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial) cells and suggested that glucocorticoid binding to GR may directly regulate CYP3A gene expression in A549 cells (Figure 2B), based on inhibition using RU-48615,24. However, these pathways have not been evaluated in primary lung cell cultures or lung tissue.Figure 2. Possible mechanisms for the induction of CYP3A genes in lung cells.(A) Active glucocorticoid will bind to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which forms a homodimer and translocates to the nucleus. The homodimer binds to its response element (GRE) and induces the expression of either the pregnane X receptor (PXR) or the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR). CAR or PXR (though this receptor is not expressed in the lungs) forms a heterodimer with the retinoic X receptor alpha (RXRa) which in turn induces the expression of the CYP3A enzymes via binding of the respective response-elements (CARE and/or PXRE). (B) Active glucocorticoid will bind to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which forms a homodimer and translocates into the nucleus. The homodimer binds to its response element (GRE) and induces the expression of CYP3A enzymes.The purpose of this study was three fold: to evaluate the changes in the expression of CYP3A mRNA in primary lung cells treated with glucocorticoids; to determine which pathway was responsible for glucocorticoid-induced changes in CYP3A mRNA expression; and to determine the role of BDP metabolism in this phenomenon. The cell lines used in this study were BEAS-2B (immortalized bronchial epithelial cell line), NHBE (normal human bronchial/tracheal epithelial cells), lobar epithelial cells (secondary bronchus epithelial cells), primary cells recovered from tracheal washes of pediatric patients on ventilation, SAEC (small airway epithelial cells), and A549 (human lung adenocarcinoma) cells. It was hypothesized that CYP3A5 mRNA induction in primary cells by BDP11 and other glucocorticoids would occur via a mechanism involving GR/CAR/RXRa, as previously demonstrated using hepatocytes.","14 Nov 2013","Approved","Philip Ballard, University of California San Francisco, USA",NA," The revisions are appropriate and the paper is improved.

The primary recombinase in BRCA2 repair of DSB through homologous recombination is the RAD51 protein, belonging to the conserved RecA/RAD51 family6, that binds to the BRCA2 protein at various segments of ~30 amino acids (BRC repeats)7,8, and in the C-terminal region in most vertebrates9,10. Checkpoint kinases phosphorylate a serine9 and a threonine10 at the carboxy-terminal region of BRCA2, thereby regulating its interaction with RAD51. BRCA2 also plays a key role in fostering genomic variability through meiotic recombination11,12, although a different recombinase (DMC1) is implicated in this pathway in mammalian species13.The BRC repeats have helped identify BRCA2 orthologs in various eukaryotic species14. Functional characterization of this gene in Drosophila melanogaster has demonstrated its interaction with RAD51, and a critical role in mitotic and meiotic DNA repair as well as homologous recombination11,15. The copy number of the BRC repeats differs considerably. The BRCA2 homolog in Ustilago maydis (a yeast like fungus) has a single BRC repeat16, the D. melanogaster homolog contains only three (known) repeats14, while there are eight repeats in the human BRCA2 gene7. Even among the Drosophila genus, the range of BRC repeat numbers is varied - the D. melanogaster species has only three repeats, while D. persimilis and D. pseudoobscura have up to eleven repeats17. RAD51 shows varying affinity for the different BRC motifs18,19. This difference in repeat numbers in Drosophila has raised doubts whether ‘this higher repeat number is real or a genome mis-assembly artifact’20, and also led to speculation on the evolution of these closely related organisms17,20. Any such hypothesis would need to be revisited if a new BRC motif were to be identified in D. melanogaster.In the current work, the putative threonine phosphorylation site for checkpoint kinases (Chk1/Chk2) (E=9.1e-4) and a new BRC repeat (E=17e-4) in D. melanogaster has been identified, using a fragmented technique for the pairwise alignment of two sequences (FRAGAL). The reference and target sequences are sliced into fragments of equal parameterized length X, sliding along the sequence in intervals of length Y, such that Y is less than X. Thus, the slices have overlaps. An alignment of all pairs of slices in the reference and target proteins is done using the global alignment program ‘needle’21 from the EMBOSS suite22. The gap penalties are adjusted to discourage gaps in the middle of the alignment. The results of the best matches are sorted based on differing criteria to aid the detection of known and putative sequences. In order to establish the generic nature of the FRAGAL methodology, the detection of a new half-a-tetratricopeptide (HAT) repeat sequence (E=11e-4) in a nucleolar RNA-associated protein (Utp6) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is also reported. HAT is a helical repeat motif implicated in various aspects of RNA metabolism23,24. The characteristic three aromatic residues with a conserved spacing are observed in this new HAT repeat, further strengthening my claim25.Existing methods for detecting functional motifs in a given protein sequence have been unable to detect these putative sites. For example, meta servers (http://myhits.isb-sib.ch/cgi-bin/motif_scan, http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/pfa/iprscan/, http://www.genome.jp/tools/motif/) for detecting motifs in a protein have been unable to detect the sites identified using the FRAGAL methodology. These meta servers use one or more motif databases26–30. Not all known BRC repeats have a low E-value when aligned with the new BRC repeat. For example, the first BRC repeat in hBRCA2 when aligned to the new dmBRCA2 repeat has an E=0.04, much more than the E=17e-4 observed for the fourth repeat, which is the one I report here. Ideally, if one took all the BRC repeats and did a search in the dmBRCA2 sequence, this new repeat would be reported. Essentially, this is what FRAGAL does - albeit implicitly, by automatically fragmenting the sequence. The same logic applies to the HAT repeat, where the sequences are more varied and thus the choice of the repeat would effect the detection of new motifs.Spliced alignment techniques have frequently been adopted in the precise identification of eukaryotic gene structures, and in gene assembly. These methods try to solve the exon assembly problem by searching the exon sequence space to find the best fit to known proteins31,32. While these methods use graph algorithms to solve the computationally difficult problem of exon chaining, FRAGAL does the converse of finding best matches in known exon chains (i.e. protein sequences).It is fair to mention that the FRAGAL method is much more computationally intensive than the above mentioned methods. At the same time, FRAGAL makes no assumption of any knowledge of the conserved regions (either the sequence or their position). The choice of the fragment length in FRAGAL depends on the length of repeats that is expected to be present in the protein. Since both repeats (BRC and HAT) discussed in this manuscript are around ~30 amino acid long, I have chosen a fragment length of 50. A larger fragment length might mask the similarity in the core region due to variations in the non-critical regions, whereas a smaller fragment would match irrelevant portions and thus increase false positives.The significant conservation of the DNA repair and checkpoint pathways in flies and higher organisms33, the advanced genetic tools available for Drosophila, and the viability of the Drosophila BRCA2 null mutants in contrast to mammalian mutants34 establishes Drosophila as a model organism for studying these pathways35. Significant divergence of key conserved sequences proves to be a serious hurdle for alignment techniques to annotate and associate the conserved sequences in the human BRCA2 to the Drosophila BRCA236. Thus, a generic methodology, applicable to distantly evolutionary related proteins like BRCA2 and nucleolar RNA-associated proteins is presented. The methodology has been validated by the identification of two novel functionally relevant sites in the BRCA2 protein from D. melanogaster, and a HAT repeat in Utp6 from S. cerevisiae.","28 Nov 2013","Approved","Saurabh Sinha, Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA","Author Response 17 Sep 2013"," I have read the author's rebuttal carefully, and am now completely satisfied with how he has addressed my previous comments.

The contribution of this work is mainly in the form of the FRAGAL tool, and the title could be trimmed to emphasize only that. The two example applications to finding the phosphorylation site, BRC repeat etc. Are not experimentally substantiated biological claims, and may be better off being left out of the title. Since this work began in search for unannotated fragments of the dmBRCA2 sequence, and is being followed in the lab actively, I think the reference to an application of FRAGAL is warranted. However, I have removed the reference to the HAT repeat and stated the fact that the phosphorylation site and the BRC repeat is putative in the title.Clear discussion should be provided regarding other previous work where pairs of aligned fragments are stitched together... I have discussed the spliced alignment approach to genome assembly in the discussion. However, I have noted that while these methods use graph algorithms to solve the computationally difficult problem of exon chaining, FRAGAL does the converse by finding best matches in known exon chains (i.e. protein sequences).Since the FRScore does not include gap penalties, I am assuming that each pair of fragments is subjected to two distinct similarity-scoring approaches; the gap-based approach when aligning that pair of fragments using 'needle' and the match/mismatch based approach when ranking the aligned pairs. This should be stated clearly, to avoid confusion. Is there a reason why the needle score was not used in place of the FRScore? The needle score includes gap penalties, which is something that is not intended for use in FRScore, as you have correctly pointed out. The idea is to direct the alignment to discourage gaps – but once the alignment is done a gap should not have a penalty. It is ‘real' and therefore only the identity or similarity that matters.It appears that the FR score is the unweighted sum of %similarity and %identity. This should be stated explicitly.I have empirically assigned more weightage to the %identity based on the fact that we are searching for repeats, and expect higher conservation. This conservation is magnified a bit more by assigning higher weightage.I did not quite understand the formatting of Table 1. ... I found that presenting sub-tables A and B (which I finally realized does not relate to A and B sequences) leads to more confusion than it helps. I apologize for this confusion. The line demarcating subtables A and B was lost in the typesetting - and I missed out on detecting this error.

Similar clarifications for the HAT repeat finding exercise will also be helpful.I could only make an educated guess as to why other tools failed to detect these repeats. I believe that the tools used had a ‘sequential' methodology and therefore one match fixed the order of the next searches. Not all known BRC repeats have a low E-value when aligned with the new BRC repeat. For example, the first BRC repeat in hBRCA2 when aligned to the new dmBRCA2 repeat has an E=0.04, much more than the E=17e-4 observed for the fourth repeat (which is the one I report here). Ideally, if one took all the BRC repeats and did a search in the dmBRCA2 sequence, this new repeat would be reported. Essentially, this is what FRAGAL does, albeit implicitly, by automatically fragmenting the sequence. The same logic applies to the HAT repeat, where the sequences are more varied and thus the choice of the repeat would affect the detection of new motifs. I greatly appreciate the positive comments.The current title is rather long. The contribution of this work is mainly in the form of the FRAGAL tool, and the title could be trimmed to emphasize only that. The two example applications to finding the phosphorylation site, BRC repeat etc. Are not experimentally substantiated biological claims, and may be better off being left out of the title. Since this work began in search for unannotated fragments of the dmBRCA2 sequence, and is being followed in the lab actively, I think the reference to an application of FRAGAL is warranted. However, I have removed the reference to the HAT repeat and stated the fact that the phosphorylation site and the BRC repeat is putative in the title.Clear discussion should be provided regarding other previous work where pairs of aligned fragments are stitched together... I have discussed the spliced alignment approach to genome assembly in the discussion. However, I have noted that while these methods use graph algorithms to solve the computationally difficult problem of exon chaining, FRAGAL does the converse by finding best matches in known exon chains (i.e. protein sequences).Since the FRScore does not include gap penalties, I am assuming that each pair of fragments is subjected to two distinct similarity-scoring approaches; the gap-based approach when aligning that pair of fragments using 'needle' and the match/mismatch based approach when ranking the aligned pairs. This should be stated clearly, to avoid confusion. Is there a reason why the needle score was not used in place of the FRScore? The needle score includes gap penalties, which is something that is not intended for use in FRScore, as you have correctly pointed out. The idea is to direct the alignment to discourage gaps – but once the alignment is done a gap should not have a penalty. It is ‘real' and therefore only the identity or similarity that matters.It appears that the FR score is the unweighted sum of %similarity and %identity. This should be stated explicitly.I have empirically assigned more weightage to the %identity based on the fact that we are searching for repeats, and expect higher conservation. This conservation is magnified a bit more by assigning higher weightage.I did not quite understand the formatting of Table 1. ... I found that presenting sub-tables A and B (which I finally realized does not relate to A and B sequences) leads to more confusion than it helps. I apologize for this confusion. The line demarcating subtables A and B was lost in the typesetting - and I missed out on detecting this error. Further, naming the subtables A and B was a poor choice of names, since the sequences were also named A and B. Finally, I agree that the second column was unnecessary, as was two subtables.

During development, transcription factor mediated regulation is essential for appropriate cell fate specification, cell migration and connectivity1–3. Transcription factors also regulate plasticity including activity-dependent process of dendritic pruning, axonal sprouting and cell proliferation and survival4–6.One family of transcription factors, the LIM-homeodomain (LIM-HD) family, is known to play critical roles in regulating cell proliferation, axon outgrowth and pathfinding across several systems7–11. The LIM-HD proteins have a C-terminal homeodomain which binds to DNA and two zinc finger “LIM” domains that bind co-factors encoded by the Clim genes. The transcriptionally active complex is a tetramer comprising two LIM-HD molecules bridged by a dimer of two Clim molecules12,13. LIM-only (Lmo) proteins lack the homeodomain but can bind Clim molecules, and function as dominant-negative regulators of LIM-HD function12,14,15. At least thirteen LIM-HD (Lhx) genes four Lmo genes and two Clim genes have been identified in the mouse. A subset of genes is expressed in the embryonic and mature hippocampus and of these, Lhx2 and Lhx5 are critical to hippocampal development16. Lhx2 plays a fundamental role in early telencephalic development as a cortical selector gene11. The neocortex and hippocampus do not form in the absence of Lhx211,17. At later stages, Lhx2 plays a new role in the developing hippocampus, as a necessary and sufficient repressor of astrogliogenesis18. Lhx2 continues to be expressed in the mature hippocampus. Lhx5 is critical for hippocampal development at early stages, but is not expressed in the embryonic hippocampus once it is specified19. Lhx1, Lhx9, Clim1a, Clim2, Lmo3 and Lmo4 are all expressed in the hippocampus at embryonic and adult stages16, but no loss of function phenotypes have been reported in the hippocampus.While several studies have implicated the LIM-HD family as a key modulator of important neurodevelopmental events, the understanding of the role of this transcription factor family in the postnatal and adult brain remains relatively unexplored. These transcription factors are known to regulate cell proliferation8,20, axon pathfinding21,22 and neurite outgrowth23,24. These phenomena have parallels in the structural plasticity that occurs in postnatal and adult life. It is now well established that the same molecules that bring about the early development of the hippocampus are often reutilized in adult reorganization and structural plasticity25–27. Several LIM-HD family members continue to be expressed in the adult hippocampus16 (this study). Therefore, we explored whether these genes display activity-dependent regulation in the adult hippocampus, to provide a basis for studies that may uncover new functions for these genes in maturity.Activity dependent neuronal plasticity has been suggested to reutilize key developmental pathways to evoke plasticity in the mature nervous system. In particular, seizure models have been shown to induce dramatic changes in progenitor proliferation, axonal sprouting, dendritic reorganization, changes in neuronal cell survival and progenitor differentiation within the hippocampus28–31. Intriguingly, the nature of neuroplastic changes evoked by seizures differs quite dramatically in the postnatal versus the adult brain32–34. Regulation at the level of signaling and transcription factors has been shown to be important for structural plasticity in the hippocampus35. While neuronal activity and seizures are likely to recruit major developmental signalling pathways in the hippocampus, thus far the role of key developmental transcription factor families as targets is relatively unexplored.An earlier study reported that LIM-only genes Lmo1, 2 and 3 are differentially regulated in a field-specific manner in the adult rat hippocampus in response to kainic acid-induced seizure36. We examined a broader set of Lmo and LIM-HD genes as well as their co-factors in a similar paradigm, not only in the adult rat hippocampus, but also in early postnatal stages when hippocampal circuitry is not fully developed37–39. Our study provides evidence that LIM-HD, LIM-only, and Clim gene mRNA displays selective field-specific regulation in the hippocampus in response to kainate induced seizures. This provides a basis to explore potential new functions of these genes in activity-dependent synaptic plasticity.","28 Mar 2014","Approved","Stan Leung, Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, University of Western Ontario, Canada",NA," The authors showed field-specific changes in expression of LIM-HD genes Lhx1, Lhx2, and Lhx9, LIM-only gene Lmo4, and cofactor Clim1a in the adult hippocampus at 6 hours after seizure induction by kainic acid. No significant changes in expression were observed after seizure induction with the same dose of kainic acid in rat pups of postnatal day 7 (P7). The subfield-specific changes in expression after kainic acid seizures were clearly presented for different members of the LIM-HD/ LIM-only family of transcription factors.  This work extends previous studies that showed seizure-induced changes in expression of LIM-only genes in adult rats. The lack of expression change in P7 rat pups may be related to the lack of seizure-induced structural plasticity in immature animals, i.e., lack of cell death, mossy fiber sprouting and neurogenesis. Members of the LIM-HD family of transcription factors are necessary for different aspects of the development of the hippocampus. Thus, the changes in these transcription factors after seizures in adult rats may be related to seizure-induced neural plasticity, such as axon sprouting, progenitor proliferation, and changes in neuronal cell survival. The central question of whether LIM-HD/ LIM-only transcription factors are causally related to the neural plasticity induced by kainic acid seizures remains unanswered. Are transient changes in these transcription factors, at ~6 hours after seizures, sufficient or necessary for the structural changes induced by kainic acid seizures? The design of the present study does not allow the consequences of kainic acid seizures to be studied, and not all adult rats induced with kainic acid seizures showed plasticity to the same extent. In fact, whether seizures are essential for the expression changes is not totally clear. In other studies, a single dose of kainic acid (intraperitoneal 10 mg/kg) may not induce seizures in all adult rats, and the 10 mg/kg i.p. given to P7 rats was >5 times the dose needed for seizures as reported by Lynch et al. (Eur J Neurosci, 2000).  The authors should provide some justification of the kainic acid dose used, in terms of seizure induction in their adult and P7 rats. “Regulation” in the title apparently means “changes in expression” rather than better control or lack of control of the genes and cofactors.The results are presented in an organized manner.I would prefer to see the sample sizes (Ns) in the figure legend rather than in the “Quantitation and data analysis” section.The issue of whether seizures are necessary and sufficient for the expression changes can be further discussed. Perhaps other molecules implicated for seizure-induced plasticity, e.g., neurotrophins, should be mentioned.Overall, the experimental study appears to be well done. I have read this submission. I believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard. Competing Interests: No competing interests were disclosed.

It is a progressive disease with symptoms appearing around 6 to 18 months after birth. After a normal developmental period, girls show growth retardation, microcephaly, stereotypic hand movements, motor abnormalities, mental retardation and communication dysfunction1. Most RTT cases are sporadic, but using information from rare familial cases, Amir et al. did manage to identify mutations in the MECP2 gene as the origin of 95% of classic RTT cases2.The MECP2 gene encodes for the methyl-CpG binding protein 2, an abundant nuclear protein identified in 1992 for its capacity to bind methylated DNA3. MeCP2 is particularly abundant in mature neurons and favors brain development and maturation4–6. Although MeCP2 was initially thought to be mostly a transcription factor, it has become apparent, over the past few years, that MeCP2 is expressed at extremely high levels in mature neurons, and that one of its central functions is to influence chromatin architecture by assuming a histone H1-like role7.The MECP2 gene consists of four exons giving rise to two different isoforms of the protein due to an alternative splicing of the mRNA. In addition, the MECP2 mRNA has a long highly conserved 3'-UTR with three sites of polyadenylation generating three different transcripts for each isoform. The first isoform to be described was MeCP2_e2, which contains all four exons with the initiation site in exon 2 giving rise to a protein of 486 amino acids in humans and 484 in mice8. MeCP2_e2 is also sometimes referred to as MeCP2A, mostly in humans, or MeCP2ß, mostly in mice. The MeCP2_e1 isoform (also called MeCP2B or MeCP2a was identified eleven years later, both in human9 and mouse10. It lacks exon 2, and thus consists of exons 1, 3 and 4, with the starting codon in exon 1, giving rise to a protein of 498 amino acids in humans, and 501 in mice (see Bienvenu and Chelly8 and Figure 1A).Figure 1. A). Graphical representation of the MECP2 gene and mRNA.Adaptation from Mnatzakanian et al.9 and Kriaucionis and Bird10, showing alternative splicing for the e1 (or B, or a) isoform above the gene and for the e2 (or A or ß) isoform below the gene. B). Alignment of mouse (m) and human (h) MeCP2_e1 and MeCP2_e2 proteins sequences. Boxes delineate the peptides’ sequences chosen for immunization: in the N-terminal region peptides correspond to regions that differ between the two isoforms, whereas in the C-terminal region, the amino acid sequences are identical to both isoforms. The sequence of the 15-mer peptide used to produce the Abcam2828 antibody is indicated by the red line.RT-PCR analyses have revealed the presence of two transcripts in all tissues in human and mouse, and also demonstrated that the MeCP2_e1 mRNA isoform is more abundant than MeCP2_e2 in the brain, thymus and lung5,9–11. Although mRNAs for MeCP2 containing exon 2 have been identified in many placental mammals, including primates, carnivores and herbivores, many arguments suggest that the MeCP2_e1 protein may be the dominant form expressed in the brain, and the one which is more relevant to the physiopathology of RTT.Firstly, in the MeCP2_e2 mRNA, the ATG start codon present in exon 1 is followed by a very short open reading frame that terminates after 55 nucleotides (in mouse) before the starting codon in exon 2. Kriaucionis and Bird actually demonstrated that the presence of this first ATG results in very inefficient translation of the MeCP2_e2 protein10.Second, the ancestral form of MeCP2 inferred from sequence comparisons with non-mammalian vertebrates corresponds to MeCP2_e110.Third, until now, in the hundreds of sequences for MeCP2 genes obtained from patients affected by RTT, no mutation has yet been found in exon 2. On the other hand, work carried out between 2005 and 2009 has already revealed the presence of more than 10 different mutations (deletions and missense) in exon 1 in patients with classical or atypical (mild and severe form) RTT12.Fourth, in two patients showing classical phenotypes of RTT, but without seizures or microcephaly, Saunders et al. identified mutations affecting the initiation codon of MeCP2_e112, which would result in the lack of translation of the MeCP2_e1 protein, but would be expected to somewhat ‘restore’ higher expression of MeCP2_e2, similarly to what has been reported for the mouse cDNA10. Furthermore, at the meeting of the American Society for Human Genetics held in San Francisco in November 2012, the group of J. LaSalle reported that transgenic KO mice carrying the equivalent single point mutation in exon 1, invalidating the initiation codon for MeCP2-e1, recapitulated a typical RTT-like phenotype13.Lastly, a recent report documented that, in four classical RTT patients harbouring mutations in exon 1, there were normal levels of MeCP2_e2 mRNA14.On the other hand, even if the mRNA coding for the MeCP2_e2 protein isoform does not suffice to prevent a RTT phenotype15, this isoform must be able to fulfill most functions of MeCP2_e1 since, in MeCP2 KO mice, the pathologic phenotype could be rescued by a tau-driven transgene based on the MeCP2_e2 cDNA16. It is also worthy of note that for historical reasons, many of the studies based on the expression of recombinant MeCP2 were using cDNA constructs coding for the MeCP2_e2 isoform. A recent study has, however, established that expression of either isoform could prevent the RTT-like phenotype in MeCP2-/y mice, although the rescue of the clasping and motor phenotypes was significantly higher with MeCP2_e117.To explore the expression of each protein isoform in vivo, and understand their respective contributions to Mecp2-related pathologies and especially RTT, we thought that it would be very valuable to have access to antibodies that could detect them specifically and separately. In this regard, however, all the anti-MeCP2 antibodies that we had at our disposal had been raised against portions common to the two isoforms, and would thus recognize them both. With a view to obtain truly isoform-specific antibodies, and since the commonly accepted minimal size for a peptide epitope is five amino acids, we chose to immunize rabbits with shorter peptides that overlapped by only three amino acids between the two MeCP2 isoforms. Since the initiation of our study, we have been made aware of the existence of commercially available polyclonal rabbit antibodies generated against the first 15 amino acids of MeCP2_e2, namely Abcam2828, and Thermo PA1-881. For our purpose, however, a concern with these antibodies is that the 15 amino acid sequence of the peptides used for immunizations overlaps with the MeCP2_e1 sequence by six amino acids, and the possibility thus remains that this could be sufficient to lead to some cross-reaction against e1.Here, we describe the generation of these two isoform-specific antibodies, and their characterization in comparison to Abcam2828 by staining of cells transfected to express either one or the other of the two isoforms, both by immunofluorescence and Western blotting. Those antibodies were then used to compare expression of the two isoforms in the brain, which revealed a prominent expression of the e1 isoform, whilst e2 remained barely detectable.","14 Nov 2013","Approved","Mike Johnston, Division of Neurology & Developmental Medicine, Kennedy Krieger Institute, USA",NA," This interesting paper provides new evidence that the e2 isoform is absent in brain and it is consistent with the earlier paper by Itoh et al., 2012 demonstrating that selective deletion of MeCP2_e2 does not result in RTT-associated neurological phenotypes but confers a survival disadvantage to embryos carrying a MeCP2_e2 null allele of maternal origin.

Compound 48/80 (c48/80)-provoked thermal hyperalgesic responses in the hind paw tissue of male ND4 Swiss mice are mediated by the degranulation of tissue-resident mast cells2. The increased sensitivity to thermal stimulus is dependent, in part, on neutrophil influx into the affected tissue, and on histamine signaling; the response is completely abrogated in mast cell-deficient mice, and is substantially reduced by blocking neutrophil influx or treatment with histamine receptor antagonists2. The importance of neutrophil influx in nociceptive cascades has been shown in different rodent models3–5 and the important regulatory roles of inflammatory cytokines including IL-1ß, TNF-a, and IL-6 in pain signaling have also been demonstrated6,7. Here we show that c48/80-induced early thermal sensitivity in ND4 Swiss mice is markedly reduced by pre-treatment with a neutralizing antibody against TNF-a. Anti-TNF-a antibody administration does not significantly affect levels of mast cell degranulation or neutrophil influx into the affected tissue. We also found no increase in protein and mRNA levels of TNF-a in the tissue within the first 3 hours following c48/80 administration suggesting that this blockade targets pre-formed TNF-a including that stored in the granules of tissue-resident mast cells. Our data suggest that pre-formed TNF-a may act rapidly on nociceptors that are known to reside in close proximity to mast cells8 and modulate nociceptor sensitization thresholds9 and function10. TNF-a blockade therefore compromises the early, protective nociceptive withdrawal responses that normally act to protect tissues from further exposure to acute, injurious environmental stimuli11.","07 Oct 2013","Approved","Adrian Piliponsky, Seattle Children's Hospital, USA","Author Response 24 Sep 2013"," Thank you for addressing my comments.

These proteins and regions possess highly flexible structures and exist as conformational dynamic ensembles characterized by different degree and depth of disorderedness2,4,6–10. Globally, the structure of IDPs/IDPRs can be described as collapsed-disordered (molten globule-like), partially collapsed-disordered (pre-molten globule-like), or extended-disordered (coil-like)8,11. IDPs/IDPRs are highly abundant in virtually any given proteome1,3,5,12. As they are abundant constituents of all cells, tissues, and organs, and are responsible for crucial controling and regulating functions, IDPs are commonly involved in the pathogenesis of various human diseases13. This conclusion is based on numerous case studies in which a particular IDP was shown to be associated with a particular disease (including many cancer-14–19 and neurodegeneration-related proteins20–27), as well as on the results of systematic bioinformatics studies12,28–36.The phenomenon of intrinsic disorder in proteins is spreading through modern protein science, and is implemented in more and more aspects of protein functionality. The biological functions of IDPs/IDPRs include envolvement in regulation, signaling, and controlling pathways29,37,38. These disorder-based functions represent a crucial complementation to the functional repertoire of ordered proteins30,39–41. Conformational plasticity, pliability, and adjustability combined with functional versatility define the overall natural abundance of IDP/IDPRs. As a result, many (if not the vast majority) of the non-catalytic functions of proteins frequently rely on the advantages provided by the lack of a fixed unique structure30,39–41.In addition to being crucial for the functionality of many individual proteins, intrinsic disorder plays a vital role in the control of almost all cellular processes. For example, in our recent study, we analyzed the abundance and roles of intrinsic disorder in proteins involved in the various pathways related to programmed cell death (PCD)42. PCD represents a suicidal cellular response to the exposure to a set of environmental factors that trigger a chain of specific intracellular biochemical events leading to characteristic morphological cellular changes, and ultimately to cell death.The three PCD routes (or PCD types I, II and III, which correspond to apoptosis, autophagy, and necroptosis, respectively) have very different biological roles. Apoptosis is important for the development, immune regulation, and homeostasis of a multi-cellular organism. Necroptosis plays a role in the modulation of the inflammatory response in the skin and intestine, serves as a backup mechanism to clear pathogens, and is involved in the immunologically silent maintenance of the T cell homeostasis43. Autophagy controls a wide range of physiological processes such as starvation, cell differentiation, cell survival, and death44–46. It regulates the turnover of long-lived proteins, the disposal of damaged organelles and misfolded proteins, and the turnover of cellular building blocks following nutrient deprivation. As a result, autophagy typically has crucial pro-survival roles in cellular homeostasis and during stress. However, under some circumstances, it can initiate characteristic cell death44,47. Therefore, although apoptosis and necroptosis both invariably contribute to cell death, autophagy might play either pro-survival or pro-death roles47–49. As a result, the fate of the cells and the fine balance between cell death and survival of healthy cells is jointly decided by the interplay between these three PCD pathways49.Since these three major PCD mechanisms involve different signaling pathways, they can be easily distinguished from each other based on their specific morphological features and on the unique biochemical changes developing in dying cells47,50. Among the characteristic morphological features of the three PCD types are the apoptosis-specific fragmentation and condensation of chromatin, combined with the fragmentation of chromosomal DNA, characteristic fragmentation of nucleous, shrinkage of cells, and production of cell fragments known as apoptotyc bodies49; the autophagy-linked formation of autophagosomes, which are the double- or multimembrane-bound structures around the recycling-destined cytoplasmic macromolecules and organelles49,51–55; and the necroptosis-related dysfunction of organnelles accompanied by the swelling and lysis of cells56.Although a wide range of cell signals of either extracellular or intracellular origin can lead to the activation of various pathways eventually resulting in the initiation of apoptosis, the major cause of the cell death is related to the organized degradation of cellular organelles by activated members of the caspase family of cysteine proteases57. Depending on the origin of the triggering signal, apoptotic pathways are classified as extrinsic and intrinsic, and each of these pathways can be regulated at multiple levels. Furthermore, depending on the nature of the cell signals, both apoptotic pathways can be either initiated or repressed. Among the extracellular (or extrinsic) inducers of apoptosis are various cytokines, nitric oxide58–60, hormones, growth factors, and toxins61, which somehow cross the plasma membrane or transduce to affect a response. Among the major players of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway are cell surface receptors known as death receptors, decoy receptors serving as inhibitory counterparts of these death receptors, are a set of related cytoplasmic proteins62. Furthermore, this pathway is regulated by changes in the transcription levels of the death inhibitory proteins (e.g., FLIP) and by the variations in the expression levels of the specific cytoplasmic adapter proteins, such as FADD and other apoptosis-activating ligands, leading to the procaspase activation62,63. Among the intracellular triggers of apoptosis are specific signals released by a damaged cell in response to different types of stress, such as heat, radiation, nutrient deprivation, increased intracellular calcium concentration64, hypoxia, or viral infection. The intrinsic pathway centers on the mitochondria that contains several key apoptogenic factors such as cytochrome c, AIF, SMAC/DIABLO, Htra2/Omi65,66, and endoG67–69; the release of these factors from mitochondria is regulated by the pro- and anti-death members of the BCL-2 family70. Also, members of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family of functionally and structurally related proteins control both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways, serving as endogeneous apoptosis inhibitors62. Finally, a unique regulatory role is played by a transcription factor p53 via its modulation of many key control points in both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways62.Among the major molecular players of autophagy are the mammalian target of rapamycin kinase (mTOR), the ULK1 kinase complex32, the class III PI(3)-kinase VPS34, Beclin-131, and several members of the ATG family that possess various biological functions47. Regulators of necroptosis are specific to cell types being different for the apoptosis-competent and the apoptosis-incompetent cells. In fact, RIP1 kinase and death receptors play a role in activation and control of the necroptosis in the apoptosis-incompetent cells71, whereas the necroptosis of the apoptosis-competent cells is regulated by reactive oxygen species, apoptosis inducing factor (AIF), death-associated protein kinase (DAPK), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)72–75.Earlier we reported the results of a comprehensive computational analysis of 1138 human apoptosis-related proteins, 137 human proteins associated with and autophagy, and 35 human necroptosis-related proteins, and also studied 3,458 proteins from DeathBase76 (http://deathbase.org/) that included proteins from five manually curated species: human, mouse, zebrafish, D. melanogaster, and C. elegans, and 23 reference species42. This previous analysis revealed that proteins involved in the regulation and execution of PCD possess substantial amounts of intrinsic disorder; that disorder has numerous functional roles across and within apoptosis, autophagy, and necroptosis processes; and that IDPRs of the PCD-related proteins are engaged in protein-protein interactions, interactions with other partners including nucleic acids and other ligands, and are also enriched with posttranslational modification sites42. In the current study, we extend our previous work and provide information on the intrinsic disorder status of some of the major players of the three major PCD pathways: apoptosis, autophagy, and necroptosis. The extention is related to the more focused consideration of the disorder status of several specific human proteins related to the PCD pathways and consideration of the roles of disorder in functions of these proteins;, aspects not covered in the previous article. We also present a detailed description of the disorder status and interactomes of selected proteins that are involved in the p53-mediated apoptotic signaling pathways, which was not covered in the previous article. Finally, we provide analysis of available structural information for human proteins related to the p53-controlled apoptotic pathways.","23 Oct 2013","Approved","Oxana Galzitskaya, Institute of Protein Research, Russian Academy of Sciences, Russian Federation","Author Response (F1000Research Advisory Board Member) 28 Oct 2013"," This paper by Uversky et al. describes the proteins involved in programmed cell death pathways (apoptosis, autophagy, and necroptosis).

Large quantities of boron are toxic to plants, and boron toxicity is a worldwide problem in food production2. Two different classes of borate transporters were discovered in Arabidopsis thaliana3. One of them, a transporter named BOR1, is a plasma membrane borate exporter in Arabidopsis root cells, and is essential for efficient xylem loading of boron4. BOR1 and its paralogs are also involved in boron toxicity tolerance in plants5,6.It was reported that the level of BOR1 is tightly regulated by the concentration of borate in the growth environment7. At low concentrations of borate, BOR1 is stably localized to the proximal side of plasma membrane in root cells but is degraded upon application of high concentrations of borate7–9. This degradation occurred after endocytosis of the transporter from the plasma membrane and the endocytosed transporter was transported from early endosome to multivesicular body, ubiquitinated and finally targeted to vacuoles for degradation8–11. A similar boron-dependent decrease in borate transporter levels was also observed in rice12 although in this case the mechanism of the reduction was not elucidated. Thus it was not clarified whether the borate-induced endocytotic degradation of BOR1 that is found in Arabidopsis root cells is conserved among different plant species and different types of plant cells.The tobacco BY-2 cell line is widely used as a model for the analysis of the cell cycle and protein trafficking in plant cells. This cell line is advantageous for conducting pharmacological studies because of the small size of its cell clumps as well as its ability to grow in liquid suspension13. To obtain an insight into the regulation of borate transporter levels and borate sensing machinery, we investigated the localization and degradation of BOR1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion in tobacco BY-2 cells in the presence of high concentrations of borate and analyzed the effect of inhibitors for protein synthesis, protein degradation and intracellular trafficking on its degradation.","06 Nov 2013","Approved","Agustín González-Fontes, Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Cellular Biology, Pablo de Olavide University, Spain",NA," This article is an extension and confirmation of findings on the degradation of the borate transporter BOR1 in Arabidopsis thaliana tobacco BY-2 cells. From elegant and conclusive techniques used in previous works by the Fujiwara and Matsuoka groups, the authors demonstrated that, under high B supply (3-5 mM), the BOR1 transporter in transformed tobacco BY-2 (BOR1-GFP) cells was also transported from the plasma membrane to the vacuole via endocytosis for degradation, this borate-dependent process being specific for BOR1-GFP. However, unlike in Arabidopsis, BOR1-GFP did not pass through the trans-Golgi network during degradation.Interestingly, the authors showed that de novo synthesis of the borate-dependent degradation machinery of the borate transporter BOR1 is required for maintaining the degradation. However, it is noteworthy that the threshold B concentration for the onset of borate-dependent degradation in tobacco BY-2 cells was 3 mM, but in Arabidopsis root cells is only 0.1 mM B. The authors should give some additional explanation for this significant discrepancy, other than that the plant species have different high-boron sensitivity. I have read this submission.

Methods of livestock production differ in antibiotic use, and this can influence the frequency of antibiotic-resistant bacteria on retail meats. For example, antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli has been shown to be less common on poultry raised without antibiotics (RWA) as compared to poultry raised conventionally3. Likewise, organic poultry can have lower frequencies of antibiotic-resistant bacteria than poultry raised conventionally4–10, although this is not always the case11–13. Organic, RWA, and kosher food products supply a growing market niche14. Consumers perceive that they offer health benefits14–21 and are willing to pay a premium for them22–24. The actual health benefits of organic food are not always clear25, and the health benefits of kosher foods are largely anecdotal. Little is known about the frequency of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms on kosher products.The organic and RWA labels require specific production methods as stipulated in US federal regulations, whereas the kosher label adheres to religious requirements that are regulated privately. The RWA label requires that “livestock have never received antibiotics from birth to harvest”26. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) organic standard is only slightly less strict, stipulating that “The producer of an organic livestock operation must not sell, label, or represent as organic any animal or edible product derived from any animal treated with antibiotics”, but also that “Poultry or edible poultry products must be from poultry that has been under continuous organic management beginning no later than the second day of life”26,27. Therefore, injecting antibiotics into eggs or administering them during the first 24 hours of the chick’s life will not violate the letter of the USDA organic standard28,29. Kosher production differs from organic and RWA in that it is inherently predicated on religious requirements. For kosher meat, the major requirements are that it must be from animals that have split hooves and chew their cud, it must not be mixed with dairy products, and all equipment used must be used exclusively for kosher food19. Animals must be slaughtered “humanely”, and meat is typically salted to remove blood rapidly, a practice that has been shown to reduce the microbial load30. Unlike for organic and RWA, kosher poultry is not regulated by Federal laws but rather by private certification organizations, and thus the specific practices vary19.Here, we compared four major types of poultry-conventional, kosher, organic, and RWA-in order to assess the frequency of contamination with antibiotic-resistant E. coli. We focused on poultry products from a major metropolitan center (the greater New York City area) and products available to typical consumers by studying multiple brands of chicken from multiple stores. Our goal was to compare the frequency of antibiotic-resistant E. coli in these four categories of chicken.","17 Sep 2013","Approved","Irene Hanning, Food Science and Technology, University of Tennessee, USA","Author Response 17 Sep 2013"," All previous comments have been addressed by the authors.

First, the text describing Table 2 in versions 1 and 2 should read, 'Bold text denotes significant differences among categories according to Chi-square test'. No ANOVAs were used for binary response variables (in this case, resistant or not resistant). For the test of brand effects, we used ANOVA on non-transformed count data, as reported in the text and in Table 1. We also used the Kruskal-Wallis rank-sum test, which is arguably better suited to count data as it does not require the assumption of a normal distribution (though we did not report those tests). With the Kruskal-Wallis tests, we also found no significant effect of brand within chicken categories. (We will include these results in the next version.)  Therefore, we combined brands in our tests comparing drug resistance among categories, as shown in Figure 1B. As identified on the vertical axis in Figure 1B, the dependent variable in the ANOVA was the number of drugs to which strains were resistant (non-transformed). The result is identical using the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test, which also identified a significant effect of category: chi-squared = 9.3891, df = 3, p-value = 0.02454. We also used a general linear model assuming the Poisson distribution which is typical of count data, an approach that allows multiple mean comparisons using the ‘multcomp’ package in R. Tukey’s post hoc tests from the GLM also supported the findings that E. coli from Kosher chicken samples were resistant to more drugs than conventional (P=0.001), organic (P=0.002), and RWA (P<0.001). Thus, our findings are robust and consistent across a number of statistical models.   We confirm that resistance was defined as a binary variable, as recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, and as stated in the methods: ‘Breakpoint guidelines from the CLSI M100 Tables 2A through 2J for E. coli (reference 31) were used to classify strains into ""resistant"", ""intermediate"" or ""susceptible""; designations of ""intermediate"" were lumped with ""resistant"" for purposes of statistics and inference, a conservative approach with respect to consumer safety.’ Thus, our use of a binary variable for resistance is consistent with the most recent standards for evaluating resistance. Nevertheless, we agree with Dr. Stärk that there is merit in considering resistance as a continuous function, and for this reason we provided the raw (continuous) data used to evaluate resistance (see the data depositied on Figshare). Thus, if new standards develop, or if interested readers wish, the raw continuous data are available for analysis.   We agree with Dr. Stärk that linking the resistance status of the food product to exposure of the animal to antibiotics would provide a stronger basis for causal inference about the source of resistance and identify ways that resistance could be mitigated. However, it would not affect the overall conclusion that production methods yield different frequencies of resistance in E. coli, a conclusion that our data clearly support. Obtaining data about on-farm use of antibiotics in the US is nearly impossible at the current time. We hope that analyses like ours help pave the way to greater openness in the industry with respect to the on-farm use of these powerful drugs, and therefore stronger inference about their impacts on food and people.

Solid tumors can be followed in their native tissue when tumor cells are administered properly into their orthotopic tissue, or when tumors are chemically induced or arise spontaneously, for instance in genetically engineered mouse models. Though in vivo imaging systems are advancing rapidly, imaging orthotopic tumors within the animal, especially at the cellular level for extended periods of time dynamically and continuously, remains a significant challenge. Subcutaneous models that implant rodent or human tumor cells directly into the skin of animals have quickly become the most commonly used tumor models5–7, in part because these tumors are convenient, easy to implant, and are readily imaged outside the body4,8.Recent advances in intravital microscopy (IVM) have made subcutaneous tumors even easier to image dynamically at higher resolutions in live rodents through dorsal skinfold window chambers7,9,10. Standard light and fluorescence microscopy in this system can distinguish individual cells in the tumor so that many cellular events, such as cell migration, mitosis, pyknosis, apoptosis, and the growth of blood vessels, can be readily quantified. Intravital microscopy can also be particularly powerful for evaluating tumor imaging probes and therapeutic agents by visualizing at high resolution and quantifying tumor targeting, delivery, processing and efficacy in vivo, dynamically and continuously.Tumor cell interactions with the surrounding tissue stromal environment, including extracellular matrix, local enzymes and proteases, vasculature, inflammatory cells, growth factors and hormones, can significantly affect tumor development11–13 and are, to a large extent, extensively altered or even missing when tumors are grown in ectopic environments such as skin14–18. Most orthotopic tumor models and especially spontaneous tumors are not readily amenable to IVM except possibly acutely for very short periods after surgical exposure, which frequently can be quite invasive. Moreover, injecting tumor cells properly to maintain an orthotopic tissue microenvironment can be quite difficult, in part because the orthotopic organ to be injected can be so very tiny in the mouse. Making sure that all of the injected cells enter and stay inside tiny organs can be quite challenging. Microsurgical techniques with stereomicroscopic imaging can help but greatly increase the labor per mouse.Recently, we have successfully engrafted donor tissue from healthy rat organs and mouse prostate tissue with hormonally sensitive prostate tumor cells into the dorsal skinfold of mice carrying a window chamber for dynamic and continuous IVM imaging in vivo19,20. The implanted tissue maintained both tissue- and species-specificity, even expressing key organ-specific biomarkers19. Here, we expand this tissue transplantation and revascularization model to multiple cancers by engrafting different donor tissues with various tumor spheroids to create novel ectopic-orthotopic (EO) tumor models that permit dynamic imaging by IVM while attempting to provide and maintain an orthotopic stroma microenvironment for the tumor cells. Comparative IVM analysis of these tumors directly shows the critical incorporation of the co-engrafted tissue into the stroma of the growing tumor and ultimately the pronounced importance of this stroma and unique microenvironment for tumor growth and angiogenesis.","05 Mar 2014","Approved","Hong Zhao, Department of Systems Medicine and Bioengineering, Methodist Hospital Research Institute, USA","Author Response 08 Aug 2013"," I have read this submission.

time and comments. We agree that tissue
attenuation of fluorescence signal is likely and could contribute to an
underestimation of tumor growth. But that is why we performed two different
measurements, including one based on tumor area which is defined by the pixels
reaching a minimum threshold fluorescence signal from the glowing tumor cells
and thus will be much less sensitive to such attenuation. The results were very
similar with both measurements. Consistent with this, these tumors tend to grow
more in 2-dimensions and be a bit flattened and not so spherical in shape, in
part because of the glass coverslip. Not sure that this issue is all that
critical to our findings and conclusion; for the purposes of comparisons made
in the paper, we used the same methods which quantified growth differences that
were not particularly subtle but rather quite obvious from the captured images. Performing ex-vivo measurement of tumor size and weight somewhat defeats the overall purpose
behind using IVM and this model system. We wish to get dynamic and continuous intravital
data on the tumors at multiple scales and ultimately avoid using huge
numbers of animals to get data that may only be a bit more accurate but at such
a considerable cost in many different ways. There are some advantages here:
because we are using tumor cells that provide the fluorescent signal
specifically, we can be sure that our measurement reflects actual tumor cells
and not other events that can appear to contribute to tumor size and apparent growth
such as dead cells, infiltration of other cells, hemorrhage, edema, etc. Here
we wish to examine effects of stroma/tissue implantation on the tumor cells
themselves in-vivo and their proliferation. So our approach is more direct and maybe
even better in many respects than simple tumor excision and weighing.  We have compared our
definition of apoptotic cells with tunnel assays and they were very similar in
their assessment of apoptosis. This was reported in reference 20. We have added
a sentence in this regard in the methods citing this paper. We are able to observe the blood including cells circulating through unmistakable
blood vessels. The static images shown were taken from our movies. When we set
up these measurements, we picked darkness thresholds that highlighted unambiguous
vessels with clear blood flow. We have frequently used various fluorescent
tracers which as expected provide a signal that coincides with the blood flow
seen through the vessels. But this extra procedure on the mice ultimately was
unwarranted for this singular purpose because it did not really augment or
refine our measurement of vascularity. Again ex vivo evaluations seem contrary
to noninvasive, dynamic, continuous, in vivo imaging attained here and would
likely add more effort and animals but little beyond the results and
conclusions provided more efficiently through IVM. We appreciate these comments
and have added further description of the vascularity measurement in the
methods to provide more clarity to the reader. We would like to thank the reviewers for their

critical to our findings and conclusion; for the purposes of comparisons made
in the paper, we used the same methods which quantified growth differences that
were not particularly subtle but rather quite obvious from the captured images. Performing ex-vivo measurement of tumor size and weight somewhat defeats the overall purpose
behind using IVM and this model system. We wish to get dynamic and continuous intravital
data on the tumors at multiple scales and ultimately avoid using huge
numbers of animals to get data that may only be a bit more accurate but at such
a considerable cost in many different ways. There are some advantages here:
because we are using tumor cells that provide the fluorescent signal
specifically, we can be sure that our measurement reflects actual tumor cells
and not other events that can appear to contribute to tumor size and apparent growth
such as dead cells, infiltration of other cells, hemorrhage, edema, etc. Here
we wish to examine effects of stroma/tissue implantation on the tumor cells
themselves in-vivo and their proliferation. So our approach is more direct and maybe
even better in many respects than simple tumor excision and weighing.  We have compared our
definition of apoptotic cells with tunnel assays and they were very similar in
their assessment of apoptosis. This was reported in reference 20. We have added
a sentence in this regard in the methods citing this paper. We are able to observe the blood including cells circulating through unmistakable
blood vessels. The static images shown were taken from our movies. When we set
up these measurements, we picked darkness thresholds that highlighted unambiguous
vessels with clear blood flow. We have frequently used various fluorescent
tracers which as expected provide a signal that coincides with the blood flow
seen through the vessels. But this extra procedure on the mice ultimately was
unwarranted for this singular purpose because it did not really augment or
refine our measurement of vascularity. Again ex vivo evaluations seem contrary
to noninvasive, dynamic, continuous, in vivo imaging attained here and would
likely add more effort and animals but little beyond the results and
conclusions provided more efficiently through IVM. We appreciate these comments
and have added further description of the vascularity measurement in the
methods to provide more clarity to the reader. Competing Interests: Author Close REPORT A CONCERN"

It is a subtilisin homologue and a member of peptidase family S8. It is unclear what the physiological role of Isp1 is; it has been shown not to be important during sporulation where the majority of intracellular proteolysis occurs, even though intracellular proteolysis was correspondingly low when a defective mutant of Isp1 was created2. Potential physiological substrates that have been identified include elongation factor Tu (cleavage within the GTP binding domain, PF00009) and ClpC, a negative regulator of genetic competence (with one cleavage occurring in a disordered region and another in a coiled-coil region)3. The peptidase is synthesized as a precursor with an N-terminal, 18-residue propeptide that blocks the active site. Release of the propeptide is probably by Isp1 itself, inter-molecularly4. The structures of both the precursor and the mature peptidase have been solved and show that a proline residue (Pro8) introduces a kink in the backbone that shifts the scissile bond in the propeptide away from the catalytic serine. Once the propeptide is released, the peptidase active site forms correctly4.The activity of a powerful endopeptidase within the cell must be controlled in order to prevent unwanted proteolysis of cellular proteins, and in 1986 Nishino et al.5 described an inhibitor of Isp1 from Bacillus subtilis known as Intracellular Protease Inhibitor (IPI). This inhibitor was effective against a number of subtilisin homologues, using casein as a substrate following pre-incubation of peptidase and inhibitor, but was ineffective against cysteine, aspartic and metallopeptidases. A Ki for inhibition of the Isp1 peptidase was estimated to be in the order of 10-9 M6. The gene for the peptidase has been cloned7, and the deduced protein sequence showed, at the time, no similarity to any other protein. There are now 149 homologues in the Pfam family PF12690 (BsuPI). The family was included in the MEROPS database (as I228), but subsequently removed, because it was not clear whether the proteins in the family were inhibitors or competing substrates. In particular, the inhibition of intracellular peptidases Isp2 and Isp3 was “repressed” in the presence of the substrate casein6, which suggests the activity of competing substrates.Structural similarity to other known peptidase inhibitors might argue for reinstatement of the family in the MEROPS database. However, most peptidase inhibitors are secreted and intracellular peptidase inhibitors are rare. The only examples are cystatins A and B from family I25, which inhibit cysteine peptidases9; calpastatin, which inhibits the intracellular peptidase calpain10; chagasin from the zooflagellate Leishmania (family I42), which also inhibits cysteine peptidases11; three intracellular coagulation inhibitors from the horseshoe crab Tachypleus that are serpins from family I412; and pinA from family I24, which is an inhibitor of the ATP-dependent serine endopeptidase Lon, but is of unknown structure13. Despite the inhibitors being intracellular, the known target peptidases are all extracellular, with the exceptions of calpain and endopeptidase Lon. Given the paucity of known intracellular peptidase inhibitors, it would not be a surprise if the fold of IPI were different from any known inhibitor structures, especially the secreted inhibitors which are stabilized by disulfide bridges, because intracellular proteins lack disulfides.Most serine peptidase inhibitors act as if they were super-substrates, binding so tightly to the active site that they are either not cleaved, or if cleavage occurs then the fragments are not released from the peptidase. There is a bond, known as the reactive bond, which occupies the peptidase active site with residues either side occupying the S1 and S1' binding pockets (in the nomenclature of Schechter & Berger, 196814). This inhibitory mechanism is known as the standard or the Laskowski mechanism15. The residues that form the reactive bond will vary from inhibitor to inhibitor, according to the specificity of the peptidase that is inhibited. The chymotrypsin-like specificity of the Isp1 peptidase implies that the P1 residue in the reactive bond of the intracellular inhibitor should be a hydrophobic residue.A preliminary NMR study, assigning chemical shifts to the B. subtilis intracellular peptidase inhibitor has been published16, which identified beta strands. We report the complete tertiary structure of the intracellular peptidase inhibitor from Bacillus subtilis.","22 Jan 2014","Approved","Patricia C Weber, Imiplex LLC, USA",NA," I have read this submission.

The high cost and potential negative side effects of conventional pharmacotherapy, i.e. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), has stimulated interest in natural plant products with anti-inflammatory properties, as an alternative or adjunct to conventional therapy2. These products are being investigated for potential efficacy in a wide range of disorders with an inflammatory component, including arthritis and cancer3,4.Curcumin (diferuloylmethane) is a polyphenol found in turmeric derived from the rhizomes of Curcuma longa. Curcumin is traditionally known for its powerful anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties. At concentrations between 50 and 100µM it has been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties via its suppressive effects on I kappa B kinase (IKK) activity and consequently the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-<U+03BA>B) signaling pathway in various cell types, including chondrocytes5,6. However, published work suggests that curcumin is cytotoxic to both primary chondrocytes7 and transformed chondrocyte cell lines8 at 50µM and above. Primary cells in their initial passages can be more phenotypically and genotypically relevant than transformed cells and are more applicable to the clinical setting9. Therefore, the cytotoxicity observed in chondrocyte cell lines may be a consequence of the transformation induced by the SV-40 virus. The hypothesis to be tested in this study was that curcumin exerts anti-inflammatory and anti-catabolic effects on interleukin-1beta (IL-1ß)-stimulated cartilage explants at non-cytotoxic concentrations. Accordingly, we evaluated the concentrations at which a commercially available curcumin formulation (sourced from Sigma-Aldrich) was cytotoxic to primary equine chondrocytes in both monolayer and explant cultures and determined whether non-toxic concentrations could reduce proteoglycan (PG) loss and inflammatory mediator production in an in vitro model of early OA.","09 Sep 2013","Approved","Stefan Toegel, Medical University of Vienna, Austria","Author Response (Member of the F1000 Faculty) 09 Sep 2013"," The authors have adequately addressed my remarks on this submission and I do not have any further concerns regarding the acceptance of the article.

Latin America and Peru are not exceptions to these statistics2,3. Adequate management after the occurrence of a traffic incident can decrease the probability of death and disability, limit the severity caused by injury and ensure that survivors are optimally reintegrated into the community4. In high-income countries, studies have shown that of those that die due to a RTI, 50% will die within minutes after the incident or on the way to the hospital, 15% die within the first 4 hours, and 35% die after 4 hours5. In low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), the majority of deaths occur among victims before arriving at a health care facility (HCF), indicating that many deaths and complications could be prevented via adequate initial management and response5–8. The experiences of developing countries with regards to evaluating the care of RTI victims are scarce and unsystematic9. Providing quality health care services to RTI victims is also important, ensuring that they are at the center of attention of all services offered10. Patients and users have a wide spectrum of cultures and attitudes, and both demand and hope for quality in all scientific, technical and humanistic aspects11,12.ImportanceDetermining the response and quality of emergency services in LMICs is important for understanding how to strengthen these services in low-resource areas. One of the first steps to approach the problem of RTIs is to rely on solid information at a national level13, and RTIs have been considered a research priority for Peru14.GoalsTo evaluate how well the promptness of care complies with the recommendations for emergency care services during the pre-hospital and hospital periods as suggested by the US Department of Transportation (USDOT) and the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) in the USA15, and how much satisfaction the victims have with respect to the care received.

Radially, activity is rapidly distributed by local feedback loops2,3. Tangentially, long, horizontal fibers enable neurons to sense regions beyond their receptive field borders4–7. Investigating the dynamics of this circuitry with simple parametric stimuli reveals well-defined selective response properties. In carnivores and primates, where these neurons are further organized in overlaid maps8–11, it is possible to satisfactorily predict changes in the layout of these maps in accord with the distribution of the stimulus energy across different visual features12, but see13.However, these stimulus-response relationships can flexibly be modified by the specific connectivity patterns between distant neurons4,14,15. For example, a surrounding stimulus which is in itself not sufficient to drive cortical neurons above firing thresholds may exert strong contextual influences on local processing16–19. These integrative phenomena are conceived as the functional backbone of various Gestalt criteria of perceptual organization20 and naturally occurring visual tasks such as contour forming, figure-ground separation, object segmentation, or perceptual completion. Hence, local-to-local interactions are intrinsically tied to the integrative functionality of cortical operation. They can be conceptualized as biases originating from the cortical architecture that foster optimal coordination of large numbers of neurons in accord with the statistics of incoming signals21–23.Today, a large body of evidence indicates that the functional properties of neurons are specifically adapted to process signals that are of ecological relevance24–26. Neuronal stimulus-response properties exhibit higher sensitivity27, selectivity28 and reliability29,30 in response to visual features when these are presented within their natural sensory context. However, direct functional evidence showing that cortical connectivity mediating local-to-local coupling embeds empirical statistical knowledge of natural inputs is at best scarce and it is not clear whether these interactions studied with simple stimulus configurations extrapolate to complex dynamic conditions that mimic natural input.We recorded cortical activity using voltage-sensitive dye imaging31 in response to locally presented natural movies recorded by cats in a natural habitat26. We characterized contextual effects by manipulating the spatiotemporal statistical regularities between two movie-patches; we tested the hypothesis that cortical circuits responsible of contextual effects are functionally adapted to natural input statistics. Our results show that, under dynamic natural stimulation conditions, facilitatory interactions across distances beyond the classical receptive field characterize contextual effects, demonstrating that cortical circuits embed functional knowledge about the spatiotemporal relationships inherent in natural scenes.","04 Mar 2014","Approved","Diego Contreras, Department of Neuroscience, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, USA","Author Response 09 Aug 2013"," I have read this submission.

Clearly, there exist a remarkable number of studies (references in
main text) about contextual effects using local grating patches of
certain orientations and spatial frequencies.In our work we
follow instead the hypothesis that the low-level sensory regions (if
not the whole nervous system) are wired to optimally process inputs
that are most likely to be received from the sensory organs. Our
recent report 26 suggests that the cortical state (i.e. both the
dynamic range and mean activity) is qualitatively different when
stimulated with gratings as compared to ecological stimuli. Thus,
response behavior to natural input can deviate significantly from
predictions based on simple parameterized stimuli, probably due to
the extensive spatial information in natural images 22, 29.These observations
may place the burden of justification on the use of simple stimuli,
and not of natural stimuli as used in the present report. Many
intra-areal long-range facilitation phenomena in the early visual
system have been shown to occur in response to local presentations of
simple stimuli. The evidence showing that these are also functional
under more natural stimulation conditions that are more complex and
also more ecological is not clear. For instance, both the extent and
the impact of long-range connections may critically depend on the
correlation structure across neuronal populations (Lindén et al., 2011), which in turn
emerges from the specific spatio-temporal correlations of visual
input. Therefore, in this manuscript, we aimed to demonstrate that
long-range interactions are also functional and effective under more
naturalistic stimulation conditions, which were so far not
investigated. We provide this evidence in this manuscript and we have added a paragraph to the discussion section (paragraph 4) of our manuscript.Finally, the choice
of a low number of parameters to characterize the response is data
driven. We demonstrate that our analysis captures the larger part of
variance of the response as obtained by voltage sensitive dye imaging
(VSDI) and is therefore a valid procedure. A comparison of the
dimensionality of stimulus and response space has to take into
account the non-linearity of processing in the visual system. Our use of
“contextual” is inspired by usage of the terms classical
receptive field and non-classical receptive field/context in the
visual sciences: Here one visual stimulus elicits a reliable response
at a certain location. The other stimulus does not elicit detectable
activity at that location, but as our data demonstrate modulates the
response to the former stimulus. The term “context” is intended
to denote that dependence. That is, we consider this neighboring
information as a contextual input as it doesn’t directly influence
the processing at the distant center. In all cases,
including single stimulation conditions, there were two 2D Gaussians
that were combined to fit the observed responses. The parameters were
estimated simultaneously. Using two Gaussians in all stimulation
conditions ensured that the activation at the distant locations did
not influence the fit. Most of the time, the activity spots were
clearly distant and well-isolated from each other, therefore possible
cross-contributions were negligible. Furthermore the center position
of each single Gaussian fit was constrained around the location of
the peak responses at locations A and B. This helped avoiding
complications where Gaussians could overfit noise. We now included
this information in the manuscript (Methods, page 8, last paragraph). Electrical
recordings were performed to allow for rapid retinotopic hand mapping
of the imaged area before VSDI. Electrical recordings parallel to
VSDI were done to verify occurrence of evoked spiking activity at
those cortical locations where high levels of the dye signal was
observed, i.e. around the center representation of one of the local
movie patches.
Note
that a single recording site was used. Thus, analysis of reciprocal
interactions at two locations simultaneously, as resolved by VSDI,
was not feasible. Analysis of the electrical recordings related to
particular stimulus features will be subject of a following report. The
colorbar depicts x10-4
dF/F values. This is now added to the legends of Figures 2 to 4.
Pixels with an activity smaller than 1.5x10-4
dF/F are not shown. This corresponds to the 75th
percentile of the activity distribution, as noted on the figure
legend. Responses of each single movie are depicted with their own
colormap so that the precise detailed structure of the evoked
responses can be clearly seen for each single condition. Using a
common color scale would basically eliminate the possibility to
clearly see responses to movies that evoked weaker responses.
Furthermore, the colorbar helps comparison of amplitudes across
different movies and positions. VSDI
can clearly distinguish these differences. In Onat et al.13, we
have shown that VSDI can distinguish diverse stimulus related
components in response to drifting gratings including actual
position, i.e. the retinotopic trajectory, of the grating stripes. In
the current manuscript, in Figure 2, it is also possible to see that
the same movie during double or single conditions leads to similar
temporal activity profiles (as analyzed in Figure 5). These
are peak values computed across the entire stimulation duration and
all recorded pixels. Figure
4A (top row) presents the spatial activity profiles observed on the
cortical surface that are reconstructed using the Gaussian parameters
(mu, sigma, amp) averaged across ROIs and cats. Please notice that
averaging the raw recorded data across cats and ROIs (A and B) is not
possible. This is due to the large differences in the shape of the
activity profiles across different ROIs and cats, therefore we
reconstructed these activity profiles using the fitted parameters.
Each individual data point that contributes to these spatial profiles
are depicted in Figure 4B. We
replaced the word “modelized” with “modeled”. You might view
this analysis technique as a low dimensional parametric description
of the experimental data. Minor PointsWe used the term dissonance to describe the perceptual quality of movie patches originating from different movies when shown simultaneously. We used the term super-additive, to indicate a response that is more than the sum of the two individual components when these individual components are presented simultaneously. The meaning is essentially the same as supralinear, although in the literature super-additive is used more often. Reference numbers refer to the reference list in the manuscript Point by point response to Dr Contreras: These are important
questions (please also see our response to question 3 from Dr Rosa below).

Developmental plasticity is at the core of those strategies allowing plants to modify their growth and the organs they produce in response to different environmental signals. This type of open-ended modular development enhances survival because damaged or diseased units can readily be discarded without compromising viability. Furthermore, because plants are constrained to sessile life styles, a modular growth habit affords greater versatility allowing phenotypic and genetic variation between modules to be used to the plant’s advantage, aiding adaption to pathogen life cycles1 or to longer-term environmental perturbations such as climate change. As a consequence of this profound developmental versatility, even individuals composed of cell populations derived from different plant species are viable and can coordinate the growth and development of chimeric organs2. In an elegant paper published in 1981, Whitham and Slobodchikoff3 proposed that mosaicism offers a unique adaptive advantage for plants by allowing introduction of genetic variants into the gene pool either through vegetative propagation or through sexual reproduction. They further propose that mutations arising somatically have a greater probability of being incorporated into the gene pool than mutations that arise in the gametes3 precisely because germ line cells are derived from somatic tissues that arise late in the developmental history of the plant4,5.The relatively frequent occurrence of mosaics among various plant species has been extensively utilized in the development of novel ornamentals and for the selection and maintenance of desirable traits in many cultivated crops. Any desirable cultivars that have arisen in this manner have been maintained through vegetative propagation and, to date, are responsible for a significant fraction of agriculturally important perennial plants. On the other hand, desirable traits in many important annual crops, such as rice, soybean, maize and wheat, have been introduced through classical genetic manipulations using directed breeding strategies. Once generated, annuals with good agronomic performance are usually maintained by inbreeding.In recent years, concern has grown over the presumed loss of genetic diversity resulting from the application of modern horticultural and breeding practices. Therefore, the benefit of excellent performance may come with a significant cost6,7. However, recent and surprising results suggest that even highly inbred species harbor unanticipated sources of intrinsic genetic variation. For example, highly inbred soybean cultivars have been shown to manifest significant phenotypic and genetic variation in the absence of sexual manipulation8–10. Such high intrinsic genetic variation has also been demonstrated for a number of other crop plants11.In the natural world, inbreeding occurs in many highly successful flowering plant species including wild relatives of Arabidopsis thaliana12. Therefore, in nature species that are highly inbred have persisted despite their predicted reduction in genetic diversity. Why would such inbreeding strategies be successful and what are the implications from an adaptive perspective? One possibility put forward by Barrett13 is that such populations are very successful in their particular niches and benefit from producing large numbers of genetically identical offspring. Nevertheless, selection should favor plant species that can co-evolve on time scales reflecting particular environmental challenges such as fluctuations and variations in pathogen populations. In keeping with this view, it has been shown that sequence variation in 20 diverse strains of Arabidopsis is highly non-random. In gene families mediating biotic interactions, such as those implicated in pathogen defense, variation far exceeds that seen in families involved in basic biological processes14.The underlying mechanisms driving phenotypic variation in highly inbred lines, whether domesticated or wild, have often been inferred and have had limited experimental verification. Nevertheless, relatively simple molecular approaches have provided insight into some of the genomic events coinciding with visible changes in phenotype. In flax, for example, molecular assays have demonstrated that heritable phenotypic changes induced by environmental shifts are accompanied by reproducible changes in genomic DNA including changes in total DNA content, non-random changes in DNA sequences or sequence rearrangements15–18. In soybean, reproducible non-random DNA sequence changes induced by in vitro culturing of root explants have also been demonstrated using restriction fragment length polymorphic markers19. Genomic changes manifesting similar hallmarks of biased sequence alterations have also been described for banana20 and in rice hybrids21.In the work described by Roth et al.19 soybean root explants were shown to repeatedly give rise to particular alleles that were absent in the donor plants but had previously been found and characterized in other varieties of cultivated soybean. To account for the appearance of these particular allelic variants the authors proposed that these organisms had evolved ""internal generators of genetic variation"" that mediated genome changes through some type of recombination process. In 2005, Lolle and colleagues22 described a genome-wide phenomenon in Arabidopsis hothead (hth) mutants that was very reminiscent of that described by Roth et al.19. Based on the nature and genome-wide locations of the sequence changes detected, it was proposed that a template-directed process mediated these changes and that these cryptic but stable extra-genomic templates themselves had persisted since at least the grandparental generation. Not surprisingly, this proposal met with considerable skepticism and numerous alternative explanations for these data have since been published23–28.In this study we have employed presence-absence molecular markers to test for non-Mendelian inheritance and found that Arabidopsis plants can inherit novel insertion sequences that were absent in their immediate parents. Furthermore, we show that discordant DNA-based marker profiles can be found between tissues isolated from different parts of an individual plant. These experiments demonstrate that individual plants spontaneously produce somatic sectors and are genetic mosaics. Since genetic variation can occur in the same plant in the absence of sexual reproduction, we propose that these novel insertion sequences must originate from cryptic reserves intrinsic to the host plant itself. The data presented support the original contention that a previously unknown template-directed mechanism exists22 and raise the encouraging possibility that other inbreeding species, including crop plants, may also harbor a cryptic reserve of genetic variation.","05 Mar 2014","Approved","Andy Pereira, University of Arkansas, USA",NA," This new version has adequately addressed my queries.

It possesses a photosynthetic apparatus very similar to higher plants, has a short and simple haplontic life cycle, can synthesize Chl both light dependently and light independently (unlike most angiosperms) and its genome has been sequenced1. In addition, well developed molecular tools exist for genetic manipulations of its genome. All these traits make this alga an elegant model system for dissecting oxygenic photosynthesis2,3.Chl, heme, siroheme, cobalamin, heme d1 and factor F430 are major tetrapyrroles that are involved in wide variety of essential life processes in all living organisms. Chl and heme are synthesized via a common branched pathway4,5 (outlined in Figure 1). Photosynthetic eukaryotes synthesize 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) from glutamine (Glu) bound to tRNAGlu through the C5 pathway consisting of two steps catalyzed by glutamyl-tRNA reductase and glutamate-1-semialdehyde aminotransferase4,5. ALA is subsequently converted in six steps to PPIX, the last common precursor for both Chl and heme biosynthesis4,5. Insertion of Fe2+ into PPIX by ferrochelatase (FeChel) leads to heme. Insertion of Mg2+ in PPIX by the heterotrimeric MgChel (comprised of three subunits: CHLD, CHLH and CHLI6) leads to MgPPIX, the first biosynthetic intermediate in the Chl branch6. MgPPIX is converted to Pchlide via three enzymatic steps. The reduction of Pchlide to form chlorophyllide (Chlide) can occur by two different mechanisms. One mechanism is catalyzed by the strictly light dependent enzyme NADPH:Pchlide oxidoreductase (LPOR) and occurs in all photosynthetic organisms; it is the only mechanism of Chl formation in angiosperms7–10. The second mechanism is catalyzed by the light independent NADPH:Pchlide oxidoreductase (LiPOR) and is present in anoxygenic bacteria, alga, ferns and gymnosperms11–20. The Chlide a undergoes a phytylation reaction, catalyzed by Chl synthase (CS), resulting in the formation of Chl a. In vascular plants and green algae a portion of the Chlide a is converted to Chlide b by Chlide a oxygenase (CAO) prior to phytylation21–24. Chl a is converted to Chl b by CAO via formation of 7-hydroxymethyl chlorophyll a (HCA) and Chl b can be converted back to Chl a via HCA by chlorophyll b reductase (CBR) and 7-hydroxymethyl chlorophyll a reductase (HCAR)25. This inter-conversion of Chl a and Chl b, referred to as the “chlorophyll cycle”, plays an important role in greening, acclimation to light and senescence25.Figure 1. A simplified tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway.Light regulated steps are in red. Dashed arrows denote multiple enzymatic steps and green arrows point to steps that are positively regulated by the GUN4 protein, respectively. Tetrapyrrole intermediates and enzymes are shown in black and bold black type, respectively. Readers are advised to look in the text for full names of tetrapyrrole intermediates and enzymes, which are abbreviated in this figure.Stringent control of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis is especially essential for oxygenic photosynthetic organisms that are often prone to oxidative stress. Free Chl, heme and their immediate precursors are highly photo-toxic molecules and generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) under aerobic conditions26. Hence most of the cellular Chls are usually bound to the light harvesting complex (LHC) and other photosystem (PS) proteins. Chl is made in the plastid. Most of these Chl binding proteins and enzymes of the tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathways are encoded by the nuclear genes5. Hence a tight coordination of biosynthesis of Chl with its apoprotein is necessary27. Chl and heme biosynthesis in plants is under transcriptional, translational and post-translational control at multi level and is accomplished by a complex regulatory network among the chloroplasts, mitochondria and nucleus, that is not well understood28–30.One of the major research interests of our laboratory is to identify components that play a role in the regulation of Chl biosynthesis under different irradiance conditions. We have generated a random DNA insertional Chlamydomonas mutant library and have screened it to isolate twenty one mutants that are either defective in Chl biosynthesis and/or are incapable of photo-autotrophic growth under different irradiance conditions. One of the isolated mutants (6F14) is a light sensitive mutant which shows a light intensity dependent progressive photo-bleaching and is incapable of photosynthesis under low light intensities (90–100 µmol m-2 s-1). Molecular analyses revealed that 6F14 is defective in the GUN4 (genome uncoupled 4) gene which codes for a protein that stimulates MgChel activity. 6F14 is the second gun4 mutant (gun4-II) to be identified in Chlamydomonas31. Transformation of 6F14 with a functional copy of the GUN4 gene restored the wild type phenotype. Western analyses show that the two isolated gun4-II complements are over-expressing the GUN4 protein. Chl analyses show that these gun4-II complements have 50–60% more Chl than that of the wild type strain. In this study, we present our molecular data on the identification of the mutation locus in 6F14 and its complementation.","28 Aug 2013","Approved","Kittisak Yokthongwattana, Department of Biochemistry, Mahidol University, Thailand",NA," Most of the comments I made to the original manuscript were addressed.

These attributes make it an elegant model organism to study oxygenic photosynthesis and chloroplast biogenesis2,3. In photosynthetic organisms, tetrapyrroles like Chl and heme are essential for energy metabolism (i.e. photosynthesis and respiration). Biosynthesis of Chl and heme occur via a common branched pathway that involves both nuclear- and chloroplast-encoded enzymes in most photosynthetic organisms4. In photosynthetic eukaryotes, 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is synthesized from glutamine through glutamyl-tRNA5. Conversion of ALA through several steps yields protoporphyrin IX (PPIX), the last common precursor for both heme and Chl biosynthesis5. Ferrochelatase inserts iron in the center of PPIX thus committing it to the heme branch of the pathway. Insertion of Mg2+ in PPIX by MgChel leads to Mgproto, the first biosynthetic intermediate in the Chl branch6. Magnesium chelatase has three subunits, which are CHLD, CHLH and CHLI7. The ATP-dependent catalytic mechanism of the heterotrimeric MgChel complex includes at least two steps7–9: an activation step, followed by the Mg2+ insertion8. Activation of MgChel with ATP involves CHLD and CHLI while CHLH is required for the chelation step10. CHLI belongs to the AAA+ family of ATPases. Plants have two isozymes of CHLI1 (CHLI1 and CHLI2) which are 70%–81% identical in protein sequences10. Although the functional role of CHLI1 is well characterized, that of CHLI2 is not. Most of the data on CHLI comes from studies on Arabidopsis thaliana chli mutants and the functional significance of CHLI1 and CHLI2 has not been studied in green algae10–16. In Arabidopsis CHLI2 plays a limited role in Chl biosynthesis because of its lower expression level compared to that of CHLI112–15. In Arabidopsis the CHLI2 protein amount is lower than that of CHLI1. When overexpressed, CHLI2 can fully rescue an Arabidopsis chli1chli2 double mutant12.We have isolated the first (chli1-1) mutant of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (5A7) which possesses an intact CHLI2 gene. Transformation of 5A7 with a functional copy of the CHLI1 gene restored Chl biosynthesis. Western analyses show that the CHLI2 protein level is lower than that of CHLI1 in the wild type strain and CHLI2 protein is barely detectable in the mutant strain. In this study, we present our molecular data on the identification of the mutation locus in 5A7 and its complementation.","30 Aug 2013","Approved","David Oppenheimer, Department of Botany, University of Florida, USA",NA," In this version of the manuscript, the authors have made all of the suggested revisions that I requested.

Patients with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes are more prone to cognitive dysfunction, including impaired memory and learning as well as Alzheimer’s disease, compared to age-matched non-diabetic subjects1. Cellular mechanisms that explain how diabetes negatively influences brain functioning are still not well understood, and the most appropriatemethods to diagnose and treat cognitive dysfunctionin diabetes have not yet been defined.The hippocampal formation (formed of the hippocampus proper, the dentate gyrus and the subiculum) is a key brain area for many forms of learning and memory, and is particularly sensitive to changes in glucose homeostasis. Analyses of behavioral performance and hippocampal synaptic plasticity in experimental models of diabetes have yielded inconsistent findings. While some studies suggested that water maze performance and passive avoidance tests as measures of synaptic plasticity were reduced2, others reported that these measures were unaffected3.Astrocytes are proving critical for the survival of neurons in the central nervous system (CNS), playing a role in energy metabolism, maintenance of the blood-brain barrier, vascular reactivity, regulation of extracellular glutamate levels and protection from reactive oxygen species4,5. These cells react to neuronal damage resulting from physical or chemical insults by over expression of the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). This protects CNS cells through the uptake of excitotoxic glutamate, the production of the anti-oxidant glutathione and the neuroprotective adenosine6–8, the degradation of amyloid-beta peptides and by limiting the spread of inflammatory cells9,10. Alterations in astrocytes activity were associated with diabetes-related disturbances in the brain and levels of GFAP have been under debate11,12.Changes in synaptic strength can occur within minutes of stimulation. For these changes to represent memory, they must persist for days and months. It is suggested that for the activity regulated and cytoskeletal associated protein (Arc), an immediate early gene may serve an important role in the transition to long-lasting forms of potentiation and hippocampal-dependent learning, memory consolidation and synaptic plasticity13. N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are ionotropic glutamate receptors found in the CNS and it is thought that the flow of Ca2+ through these receptors can cause both long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) vital for memory and learning14. However, overstimulation of these receptors causes neurodegeneration and excitotoxicity15.Since the impairment of synaptic plasticity in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats was linked to an inappropriate level of NMDA receptor stimulation required for the induction phase of long-term-potentiation16, this study aimed to investigate the effect of type 1 and type 2 diabetes on cognitive functions and hippocampal astrocyte reactivity and synaptic plasticity markers, and the impact of partial NMDARs blocking on these parameters.","17 Jul 2013","Approved with Reservations","Louiza Belkacemi, The Life Science Health Center, University of Western Ontario, Canada",NA," This article sought to investigate the effect of diabetes mellitus on cognitive functions and related markers of hippocampal synaptic plasticity, and the potential impact of blocking N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors by memantine in type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus in rat models.

Visual hallucinations are the most commonly reported psychotic phenomena in this population, with auditory, tactile, somatic, and olfactory hallucinations being much less common. Delusions, when they occur, often antedate visual hallucinations and commonly are paranoid or persecutory in nature2,3. In addition to the increased caregiver burden caused by psychosis and its sequelae, hallucinations in the context of chronically treated PD tend to be progressive in nature, resulting in increased propensity for nursing home placement and subsequent higher mortality4,5. These sobering associations suggest aggressive management of DIP in this population. However, either dose reduction of antiparkinsonian medications or addition of traditional neuroleptics usually increases parkinsonian motor disabilities. Atypical antipsychotics, with their comparatively lower incidence of parkinsonism in schizophrenia, have potential advantages for treatment of hallucinations in this sensitive population1.Until recently, the only treatment proven with randomized, placebo-controlled studies to reduce DIP has been clozapine, an agent that does not worsen motor function6–8. Despite these favorable data, use of clozapine has been limited secondary to its rare but potentially serious risk of agranulocytosis and the consequent necessity for frequent blood draws1. Thus alternative treatments have been eagerly sought.Quetiapine has become the most commonly prescribed antipsychotic in DIP9. Although double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of quetiapine in PD confirmed it is well tolerated in terms of motor side effects, it has not proven significantly more effective than placebo in treating psychosis10–15, and a head-to-head comparison found clozapine superior to quetiapine16. Ziprasidone showed some benefit in open-label experience17, including in a random-assignment open comparison to clozapine18. However, ziprasidone can cause motor side effects in PD and is not generally considered standard therapy for DIP1,19. Other treatments, such as ondansetron, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, and electroconvulsive therapy are supported by limited data in idiopathic Parkinson disease but are generally not viewed as first-line therapy1,19. Recently, a phase III clinical trial of a serotonin 5HT2A inverse agonist, pimavanserin, showed benefit over placebo, but the drug will not be available in the U.S. at least until late 201420–22.Clozapine’s antipsychotic efficacy is often attributed to its D4 receptor antagonism. It is also posited that its robust 5HT2A receptor antagonism, especially in relation to its relatively weaker D2 receptor blockade, actually increases dopamine transmission in prefrontal cortical and nigrostriatal projections23. This may account for the cognitive improvement as well as paucity of extrapyramidal adverse events observed in clozapine-treated patients with dopaminomimetic-induced psychosis23,24. Olanzapine, therefore, with its ostensibly similar receptor binding profile to clozapine at D2, D4, and serotonergic receptors (especially 5HT2A and 5HT2C), and muscarinic sites, provides a theoretically encouraging alternative to clozapine in this fragile population25.An initial open study of olanzapine in Parkinson disease revealed antipsychotic benefit without motor deterioration when drug dosage was optimized in a slow titration (mean daily dose at end of study was 6.5mg) and dopaminomimetic dose adjustments were allowed26. Aarsland and colleagues replicated these findings in a relatively more challenging population of Parkinson disease patients with and without dementia27. Several other small, open-label studies of olanzapine, however, have demonstrated antipsychotic benefit but at the expense of intolerable worsening of gait and bradykinesia, frequently leading to premature termination of the drug28–30. Another small open-label trial and case report series suggested unacceptable Parkinsonian motor deterioration in the context of dubious antipsychotic efficacy31,32. Later, two double-blind placebo-controlled trials revealed equivocal antipsychotic benefit and problematic motor decline in PD patients with DIP treated with 2.5–15mg/day olanzapine (mean final doses 4.1–4.6mg/day)33,34. As a result, experts have recommended against the use of olanzapine in PD1,19.None of these studies, however, were parallel-group fixed-dose trials, and some allowed for neuroleptic dose in the same range as approved for schizophrenia; experience with clozapine suggests that an effective antipsychotic dose in PD is often an order of magnitude less than that typical for schizophrenia treatment. In addition, the two double-blind placebo-controlled trials did not permit adjustments of subjects’ dopaminomimetics, which might have alleviated motoric side effects. Finally, some of the studies cited were terminated prematurely due to side effects. Given that the only marketed drug for which efficacy has been shown is clozapine, demonstrating efficacy for an alternative agent would be important, and a fixed low dose of olanzapine (2.5mg/day) may allow a reasonably low incidence of side effects if dopaminomimetic dose adjustments are allowed. We discuss here the findings of a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of fixed, low-dose olanzapine for treatment of DIP in the context of flexible dopaminomimetic dosing. The hypothesis was that olanzapine given in this fashion would reduce DIP in patients with idiopathic PD significantly more than would a placebo, without causing intolerable motor worsening.","22 Aug 2013","Approved","Eric Molho, Department of Neurology, Albany Medical Center, USA","Author Response 22 Aug 2013"," This is a well conceived and rigorously carried out clinical trial addressing an important issue in a difficult to study patient population. Although the data was collected a decade ago, the information is still relevant because remarkably little progress has been made since 2003 in the treatment of PD related psychosis. Dr. Richard’s referee response presents the methodological shortcomings and correctly points out resulting limitations in data interpretation. I agree with all of the comments in her review.In addition, I would like to add the following comments/observations: In the abstract and introduction, the authors suggest that because olanzapine has a similar receptor binding profile to clozapine, it is a good candidate drug to study in the PD population and they cite Seeman et al. 1993. More recent work by Seeman shows that what is unique about clozapine is that it binds D2 receptors “loosely” and that its receptor occupancy is short-lived. Quetiapine has a similar D2 binding profile to clozapine but, olanzapine behaves much more like haloperidol and risperidone in this regard. This may explain the motor worsening that seems to be associated with olanzapine use in PD. (Kapur and Seeman. Am J Psychiatry 2001;158:360-369. Seeman and Tallerico. Am J Psychiatry 1999;156:876-884.)I disagree with the statement in the introduction that “Delusions, when they occur, often antedate visual hallucinations....” The natural history of hallucinations in PD has been looked at in only a few longitudinal studies and the interaction between hallucination and delusions has not been adequately studied but my clinical experience and the bulk of what is presented in the literature suggests that minor hallucinatory phenomena (illusions, passage or presence hallucinations, benign hallucinations with insight) are much more common and occur earlier in PD than delusions. Delusions are generally associated with more severe underlying cognitive impairment, by definition are associated with lost insight and are generally considered to indicate a more advanced stage of disease progression than isolated visual hallucinations. (Fenelon et al. Brain 2000;123:733-745).I would also question the premise that allowing for a dopaminergic medication dose adjustment in the study protocol (to reverse any worsening of PD motor symptoms due to the introduction of low dose olanzapine) might produce study results that are a more appropriate way to evaluate how this drug might work in the clinic. My experience is that this strategy is unsustainable even in the short term in this population. One reason is that each dose increase of dopaminergic medication is prone to reignite symptoms of psychosis and thus lead to a need for higher doses of the antipsychotic, setting up a cycle of overall worsening. Secondly, these patients tend to have more advanced motor symptoms including high risk symptoms such as postural instability and dysphagia. It may be very difficult to continue a drug known to worsen PD motor symptoms after the first fall or choking episode even if one cannot be sure it was a direct result of the antipsychotic drug.   I would suggest more clearly pointing out that this study cohort had relatively mild cognitive impairment (MMSE >26) which may be quite different than what is encountered in practice. More demented patients may be more susceptible to side effects of atypical neuroleptics including sedation, encephalopathy and motor worsening. More demented patients may also have more severe psychosis which is likely to be less responsive to the low doses used in this and some other clinical trials.  Finally, I suspect that some readers may not have a full grasp of “Type II error”. This should probably be spelled out without jargon in the discussion. I have read this submission.

However, when used incorrectly, they can pose a health risk to the patient, as well as contribute to the development of bacterial resistance to these drugs. Considering the already alarming levels of resistance reported worldwide1,2 an improvement in use, in terms of indications for treatment, choice of antibiotic, dosage, duration and enhanced knowledge, are crucial steps towards containment of the problem of resistance.The majority of antibiotics are consumed in the community3, and in this setting there is plenty of opportunity for incorrect use. Particularly in countries with lack of access to and availability of health care, poor drug control, and lack of education of the population, self-medication is often common practice4,5. The high cost of medicines, incomplete treatment courses, and patient pressure on the physician for a prescription, contribute to the misuse of antibiotics. Studies from both developed and developing countries show that misconceptions about antibiotics and their use are prevalent in the lay populations6–9. It is for example frequently thought that antibiotic treatment is indicated in conditions such as the common cold, which in most cases is a condition of viral etiology4–6. The financial aspect also influences the use of antibiotics, and poor patients will often not be able to afford a doctor visit or full treatment10. On the other hand, many health care systems do not make an effort to educate either the lay population about the importance of correct use of antibiotic, or the physicians about how to best deal with these problems.In Ecuador, little is known about the use of antibiotics and the relevance of educational efforts made. In a review of the use and misuse of antibiotics in Latin America, M. J. Wolff described an ""antibiotic culture"" where treatment often is thought to be indicated at any sign of a suspected infection, which results in frequent self-medication4. In order to be able to address this and other incorrect antibiotic use through interventions, it is important to first identify the causes of these behaviors in the local context, as well as the differences between different groups in the society. Preschool children are a group that are highly exposed to antibiotics in the community11,12. However, in the case of such young children, the final decision about antibiotic treatment is taken by the child’s care giver, usually the mother. In Ecuador, despite an over-all decreasing fertility rate, the group of adolescent mothers is steadily increasing13. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate whether there are differences in antibiotic use and knowledge between adolescent and adult mothers, seeking care for an upper respiratory tract infection (URI) in their child, aged less than five years. URIs are the leading cause of morbidity and doctor consultations in children under the age of five in Ecuador14, and it was therefore chosen as a reference condition for the study.","05 Mar 2014","Approved","Liliana Clara, Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires, Argentina","Reader Comment 23 Apr 2013"," I have read this submission.

These differential responses occur simultaneously within the same milieu but why this happens is poorly understood. The degenerating nervous system is not a non-specific killing field.The observations described here derive from experiments designed to identify axonal chemorepellents in which explants of degenerating adult rat brain were co-cultured with embryonic brain explants in collagen gel matrices. Unexpectedly, we found that adult brain causes diffusion-mediated degeneration of embryonic axons and have shown that the degenerating adult brain releases histone proteins. Histone H1, but not core histones, selectively kills embryonic cortical neurons and causes microglial cells to become reactive.Histones are highly basic proteins that are present in the nucleus where they form major components of eukaryotic chromatin and function to regulate transcription. The core histones, H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 have relatively similar structures containing a histone fold domain and together form the histone octamer. The winding of genomic DNA around this octamer forms the basic unit of DNA packaging termed the nucleosome. Members of the more divergent histone H1/H5 family are structurally unrelated to core histones and function to link nucleosomes. It has usually been assumed that histones are restricted to the nucleus but a growing body of evidence indicates that histones, histone-DNA complexes and histone-derived peptides have cytoplasmic and extracellular locations and actions1.Core and linker histones and nucleosomes have been detected both at the cell surface2–6 and in the cytoplasm7,8 and have also been linked to apoptosis7–11. Several lines of evidence support the idea that extracellular histones may contribute to human disease mechanisms. Anti-histone antibodies are present in vascular dementia and pre-senile Alzheimer’s Disease (AD)12. In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), many different nuclear antigens are released and provoke high titres of destructive anti-histone autoantibodies8. Indeed, a significant proportion of patients with SLE have associated neurodegeneration. More recent evidence indicates that extracellular histones can mediate endothelial cell death and sepsis13, and cause thrombocytopenia through platelet aggregation14.","30 Jul 2013","Approved","W Sue Griffin, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, USA",NA," I think this paper excellent and is an important addition to the literature. I really like the conceptualization of a self-replicating cycle as it illustrates the concept that the “problem” starts with the neuron, i.e., due to one or more of a variety of insults, the neuron is negatively impacted and releases H1, which in turn activates microglia with over expression of cytokines that may, when limited, foster repair but when activated becomes chronic (as is demonstrated here with the potential of cyclic H1 release) and thus facilitates neurotoxicity.  I hope the authors intend to measure cytokine expression soon, especially IL-1 and TNF in both astrocytes and microglia, and S100B in astrocytes.02/08/2013 - additional commentsIn more detail, Gilthorpe and colleagues provide novel experimental data that demonstrate a new role for a specific histone protein—the linker histone, H1—in neurodegeneration. This study, which was originally designed to identify axonal chemorepellents, actually provided a previously unknown role for H1, as well as other novel and thought provoking results. Fortuitously, as sometimes happens, the authors had a pleasant surprise: their results set some old dogmas on their respective ears and opened up new avenues of approach for studying the role of histones in self-amplification of neurodegenerative cycles. In point, they show that H1 is not just a nice little partner of nuclear DNA as previously thought. H1 is released from ‘damaged’ (or leaky) neurons, kills adjacent healthy neurons, and promotes a proinflammatory profile in both microglia and astrocytes. Interestingly, the authors’ conceptualization of a damaged neuron <U+2192> H1 release <U+2192> healthy neuron killing cycle does not take into account the H1-mediated proinflammatory glial response. This facet of the study opens for these investigators a new avenue they may wish to follow: the role of H1 in stimulation of neuroinflammation with overexpression of cytokines. This is interesting, as neuronal injury has been shown to set in motion an acute phase response that activates glia, increases their expression of cytokines (interleukin-1 and S100B), which, in turn, induce neurons to produce excess Alzheimer-related proteins such as ßAPP and ApoE (favoring formation of mature Aß/ApoE plaques), activated MAPK-p38 and hyperphosphorylated tau (favoring formation of neurofibrillary tangles), and a synuclein (favoring formation of Lewy bodies). To date, the neuronal response shown responsible for stimulating glia is neuronal stress related release of sAPP, but these H1 results from Gilthorpe and colleagues may contribute to or exacerbate the role of sAPP.

Both glycoproteins have been shown to interact as a non-covalent heterodimer during biosynthesis1. Several conserved charged residues located in the transmembrane (TM) domains of E1 and E2 were shown to function not only as membrane anchors, but were also essential for dimerization, endoplasmic reticulum retention and viral envelope formation2,3.In our previous studies, we demonstrated that the unfolding behavior of the E2 TM helix monomer was attributed to the charged Asp728, which was located in the hydrophobic core. The main contribution of Asp was postulated to be located at the helix-helix interface and involved the formation of a salt bridge with the Lys of the E1 envelope glycoprotein2. The ion-pair interaction of the E1–E2 heterodimer was captured in the molecular dynamic (MD) simulation studies based on the model that placed the charged Asp and Lys at the helix-helix interface4,5.E2 envelope glycoprotein is known to be required for interactions with cellular receptors involved in endocytosis and membrane fusion6–8. E2 is composed of domain I-III, followed by the ST region and the TM domain7. Recent studies based on circular dichroism (CD) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy revealed that the soluble region located adjacent to the TM domain of E2 was involved in the initial virus entry. This highly conserved ST region was shown to fold as a helix upon membrane binding9.In this work, we carried out MD simulations for three E2 structures: (1) a model generated by the I-Tasser server, (2) an ideal helix model and (3) an NMR derived structure of the E2 segment (2KZQ.pdb). The first two models include the TM domain of E2 but the TM domain is not present in the NMR structure. We observed consistent structural stability in the ST region amphipathic segment (residue 689–703) across all simulations suggesting that the contribution of the TM domain to the segment structure stability is minimal. In addition, we demonstrated the orientation and positional preferences of this amphipathic segment.","03 Sep 2013","Approved","Gloria Fuentes, Bioinformatics Institute, A*STAR, Singapore",NA," I appreciate the effort by the authors to improve their draft following the reviewers suggestions.

The 26SP is localized in the cytosol and the nucleus, and it degrades proteins involved in many signaling and metabolic pathways1,2. The 26SP is also essential for the destruction of misfolded proteins that are generated by mistranslations and during stress2–4.Studies with proteasome mutants in Arabidopsis have revealed that the 26SP is required for both male and female gametogenesis, confirming its essential role in plant growth and development2,5,6. Partial loss-of-function mutants, on the other hand, have been indispensable for uncovering pathways in which key components are regulated by proteasome-dependent degradation7–13.The rpn12a-1 mutant, which carries an insertion in the RPN12a gene (At1g64520) encoding the regulatory particle non-ATPase subunit (RPN) 12a, was isolated from a collection of exon-trap lines14,15. These lines were generated by transforming Arabidopsis plants (C24 accession) with a T-DNA construct that contains a promoterless neomycin phosphotransferase gene (NPTII) without a starting methionine which is preceded by a 3´ splice site of the first intron of the apurinic endonuclease (APR)14. Kanamycin-resistant exon-trap lines are therefore predicted to have the APR-NPTII construct inserted downstream of an active promoter either in frame with the coding region or in a position that allows the formation of a novel, chimeric intron. The rpn12a-1 mutation is unusual because the T-DNA is inserted downstream of the RPN12a gene, and both the full-length RPN12a cDNA and a chimeric RPN12a-NPTII cDNA are produced15. This suggested that two types of cis signals involved in the pre-mRNA processing of RPN12a are competing. Because the wild-type transcript is produced in the mutant and is stable enough to be detected using routine RNA analytical procedures, the poly(A) signal of the RPN12a gene must be intact and active. On the other hand, since a chimeric RPN12a-NPTII transcript is also produced, the 3´ splice site of the inserted T-DNA must have recruited a latent 5´ splice site in the RPN12a gene. We have previously shown that this predicted latent 5´ splice site is STOP codon-associated, and that the pre-mRNA splicing of the chimeric intron leads to the production of the fusion mRNA15. As a result of the action of these two opposing pre-mRNA processing mechanisms, one part of the mRNA species transcribed from the mutant RPN12a gene is translated into a functional RPN12a protein, and the other is translated into a chimeric RPN12a-NPTII fusion protein. Because both RPN12a forms are incorporated into the 26SP, the total proteasome activity in these mutant seedlings is reduced, but not abolished15.The reduction of 26SP activity in rpn12a-1 caused a pleiotropic phenotype, which included altered responses to cytokinins15. Cytokinins are plant hormones that are essential for every aspect of growth and development16–19. For example, cytokinins control the development of meristems and vasculature, and play an important role in senescence and nutrient allocation19,20. To gain better insight into the cytokinin insensitivity of rpn12a-1 seedlings, we screened for suppressor mutants that have a wild-type cytokinin growth response. Here we describe the intragenic suppressor of rpn12a-1 (sor1) that disrupts the latent 5´ STOP-associated splice site. Sor1 reduced the expression of the RPN12a-NPTII fusion mRNA with a concomitant increase in RPN12a transcript level. As a result, RPN12a accumulation in sor1 seedlings was identical to the wild-type and was accompanied by wild-type cytokinin sensitivity. These results validate our transcript processing interpretation of the rpn12a-1 exon-trap effect and accentuate the importance of optimal RPN12a expression for cytokinin signaling.","01 Jul 2013","Approved","Patrick Masson, Department of Genetics, University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA",NA," This revised manuscript includes both a better description of the mutagenesis and screening strategy that led to the isolation of sor1 and a new experiment quantifying transcript levels.

Although I still believe this would be useful to verify this conclusion, I also think that all other data lead us to believe in the proposed model. I have read this submission.

The overlapping laboratory characteristics, clinical associations and our inability to assess accurately, but non-invasively and rapidly, the volume status of these patients are at the root of this diagnostic and consequential therapeutic dilemma1–4. In general, neurosurgeons consider RSW to be more common than SIADH in neurosurgical patients, whereas internists consistently regard RSW as a rare clinical entity. As reviewed elsewhere, RSW has in fact been found to be much more common than SIADH in neurosurgical patients and our reports of RSW occurring in patients without clinical cerebral disease introduce new challenges to determine the true prevalence of RSW5,6. This diagnostic dilemma poses a therapeutic dilemma that has significant clinical outcomes, such as the risk inherent in fluid restricting a volume-depleted patient with RSW. In addition, the recent awareness that even mild hyponatremia induces symptoms with potentially serious consequences including attention deficits, mental confusion, unsteadiness, and heightened risk for falls and fractures7–9, underscores the urgency needed to resolve this diagnostic dilemma so that the proper therapy can be instituted on first encounter with the patient7–9. Because of the erroneous perception that RSW is rare in neurosurgical patients and the unknown prevalence of RSW in patients without cerebral disease, the inappropriate fluid restriction or use of vasopressin receptor blockers in patients with RSW for an erroneous diagnosis of SIADH is probably much more common than what has been documented in the literature. Indeed, inappropriate fluid restriction of volume-depleted patients with RSW has been reported to have higher morbidity and mortality rates10–12. Our recent proposal to replace the inappropriate and outdated term, cerebral salt wasting, with RSW, therefore, has great clinical relevance because RSW would not in the past be considered unless the patient had evidence of cerebral disease1.We have utilized the persistence of an increased fractional excretion (FE) of urate after spontaneous or therapeutic correction of hyponatremia in RSW to differentiate it from SIADH where FEurate normalizes after correction of hyponatremia2,12–14. This relationship between FEurate and serum sodium has been corroborated in several publications2,10–18. The coexistence of an elevated FEurate with normonatremia appears to also identify patients with RSW without the need to correct a pre-existing hyponatremia. This notion was supported by earlier studies, which demonstrated natriuretic activity when the plasma of largely normonatremic neurosurgical and Alzheimer's disease patients with elevated FEurate were administered to rats19,20. In those rat studies, natriuretic activity was noted when the plasma was administered simultaneously by IV infusion and injection into the peritoneum, suggesting that some of the natriuretic factor may have entered the rats’ circulation by the latter route. We entertained the possibility then that the factor could be a protein small enough to be absorbed from the peritoneum, and if so, small enough to be filtered by the glomerulus as well. We postulated that the circulating protein would be filtered at the glomerulus, possibly saturating receptor sites in the renal tubule and thereby making its way into the urine. The present studies were therefore designed to investigate the presence of natriuretic activity in ammonium sulfate precipitates of urine from patients admitted predominantly to our neuroscience intensive care unit with normal or increased FEurate with or without hyponatremia in addition to SIADH.","06 Sep 2013","Approved","Pravin C Singhal, Division of Kidney Diseases and Hypertension, Hofstra North Shore LIJ Medical School, USA",NA," I have read this submission.

Although originally associated with certain types of cancer, it is now known that PTHrP is expressed by a variety of normal cell types in many fetal and adult tissues, including bone3,4. Stunted growth of the limbs and abnormalities in the craniofacial skeleton of newborn PTHrP-gene null mice served as the first evidence that PTHrP was necessary for normal skeletal development and growth5. Subsequent studies using knockout and transgenic mice revealed that PTHrP influences longitudinal bone growth by controlling chondrocyte differentiation in the epiphyseal growth cartilage6,7. While development of membrane bones is also altered in PTHrP knockout mice5, how the peptide contributes to intramembranous ossification has not been clarified.The amino terminus of PTHrP has strong homology with the comparable region of parathyroid hormone (PTH)8 and both peptides are physiologic ligands for the parathyroid hormone 1 receptor (PTH1R)9, a member of the B family of heterotrimeric G-protein-coupled receptors. The binding of either ligand to PTH1R in bone or kidney induces a conformational change in the receptor that results in the formation of a high affinity receptor-G-protein complex that catalyzes guanine nucleotide exchange on the a-subunit of the G-protein10–12. This causes the G-protein to dissociate from the receptor-ligand complex and transduce the extracellular signal from the receptor to at least two signaling pathways, the adenylate cyclase/cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway that is mediated through the Gas subunit, and the phospholipase C/diacylglycerol/protein kinase C (PKC) pathway that is mediated through the Gaq subunit13. It is now recognized that exogenously administered amino terminal PTH has anabolic and catabolic effects in the skeleton. Whether bone formation or bone resorption occurs depends to some extent on the pattern or duration of hormone exposure. Intermittent exposure to PTH (1-34) in one or two daily subcutaneous injections increases bone formation and results in a net gain in bone mass in rats and humans14,15. By contrast, continuous infusion of PTH (1-34) preferentially stimulates bone resorption and increases serum calcium in humans16 and rats15,17, with smaller effects on bone formation. The net response to continuous infusion is a decrease in bone mass15,18. Although amino terminal PTH and PTHrP bind with equal affinity to the PTH1R, intermittent PTHrP has been reported to be less effective in stimulating bone formation than equal concentrations of PTH15. This finding is interesting in light of the observation that locally produced PTHrP is required for bone formation in PTH-null mice19. How the contrasting effects of exogenous PTHrP are related to its physiologic function remains to be clarified.In several tissues, including bone, it has been reported that PTHrP and PTH1R mRNAs and/or proteins are expressed by adjacent, but different, cell populations20–22. This has led to the concept that PTHrP is a paracrine factor that regulates the proliferation, differentiation, lifespan, or function of its target cells in these tissues23. We previously found that PTHrP and PTH1R are co-expressed by skeletal and extraskeletal cells before and during intramembranous ossification of the chick mandible24. On the basis of their temporal and spatial expression we proposed that PTHrP influences the histogenesis and/or growth of skeletal tissues in the chicken mandible via an autocrine pathway mediated by the PTH1R. The present study was designed to investigate the role of PTHrP during intramembranous ossification using neonatal rat calvarial cell cultures as an in vitro model. First we compared the temporal and spatial expression of PTHrP and PTH1R with the osteoblast marker protein alkaline phosphatase (AP) during the differentiation of osteoblast cell colonies and formation of woven bone nodules. Next, we examined the effect of continuous and intermittent treatment with amino terminal PTHrP on osteoblast differentiation and bone nodule formation. Finally, possible mechanisms underlying PTHrP effects on bone nodule formation were examined by assessing cell proliferation, apoptosis, and gene expression.","21 Aug 2013","Approved","Joseph Bidwell, Department of Anatomy & Cell Biology, Indiana University School of Medicine, USA","Author Response 22 Mar 2013"," I approve the revised version of this manuscript without reservations.

A potentially important difference is that the cells used in our experiments were plated, grown, and maintained in the presence of 10% FBS, whereas Datta et al. employed serum-starvation to synchronize cells in the cell cycle and conducted their experiments in presence of 0.5-2% FBS during the period of peptide exposure. These differences in culture conditions might be a significant factor since they noted that the stimulatory effect of PTHrP on cell number and doubling time in the presence of 0.5-2% serum was not observed in cultures supplemented with 10% serum (see results section of Datta et al., 2007).

The positive effects of EE on mice (reviewed in Nithianantharajah and Hannan1) have been reported from numerous studies (from a PubMed search on 9 May 2013 using the phrases “environmental enrichment” and “enriched environment”): at least 150 papers have been published showing enhanced neurogenesis, cognitive capacity, memory, learning, neuronal pathways, and improvements in diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and brain injury. Approximately 100 papers have been published showing reduction in anxiety levels, social defeat, emotionality, depression, drug addiction, alopecia, and stereotypies. In addition, approximately 12 studies have investigated the effect of EE in infectious disease, immunity, atherosclerosis, lifespan, inflammation, asthma and obesity; and about 10 studies have dealt with its effects on olfaction, hearing, photoreceptors, and sight. Only three studies in mice have been performed on the effect of EE on cancer development or treatment.Three papers have reported on tumor growth in mice housed in enriched environments compared with those housed in standard conditions2–4. Cao et al.2 reported significantly decreased growth in subcutaneous (s.c.) B16 (by 43%), B16F10 (by 77%) and MC38 (by 55%) tumors in mice housed in EE conditions. Nachat-Kappes et al.3 reported significantly smaller s.c. E0771 mammary tumors up to 10 days after tumors were inoculated orthotopically in EE housed mice, but thereafter there was no statistically significant difference in tumor size. Benaroya-Milshtein et al.4 reported no significant difference in size of untreated s.c. 38C-13 B-cell lymphoma tumors. However, all three studies have reported statistically significant differences in other parameters between EE housed mice and standard housed mice: Cao et al.2 reported markedly lower leptin levels and upregulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in EE mice, Nachat-Kappes et al.3 reported a statistically significant increase in caspase-3 levels in the tumors of EE housed mice, and Benaroya-Milshtein et al.4 reported reduced tumor growth and significantly greater survival of EE housed mice after immunization with an idiotype-vaccine prior to tumor injection, with 44% disease-free compared with 0% in standard cages. Thus all three studies report an influence of EE on tumors.Our primary goal was to see if we could replicate the significant difference in tumor size found in the EE group by Cao et al.2, who injected B16F10 s.c. and found a 77% reduction in tumor mass in EE mice and that 17% of mice had no visible tumors, compared with 0% of mice in standard caging. If we could replicate these results, this finding would have important consequences for the way in which we would need to house mice to perform future experiments when testing therapies to combat cancer.","21 Jun 2013","Approved","Stephen Nutt, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, USA",NA," This is a clear study that attempts to investigate the role for environmental enrichment in the control of experimental tumour growth.

Among the high risk behaviors, an increase in dietary fat and salt intake, reduced physical activity, and high rates of smoking in the male population are all long standing issues1. All of these factors have contributed to the increasing number and proportion of patients suffering from chronic disease1,2. The fourth report of the National Health Services Survey in 20083, reported that 20% of the Chinese population were living with a chronic disease, an increase of 4.9% since 2003. The report also highlighted the increasingly higher proportion of rural residents living with a chronic disease. The survey estimated that nationally the total number of chronic disease cases reached 260 million in 2008, with rural residents accounting for 163 million3.Chronic disease accounted for almost 80% of all deaths, and 70% of the total disability adjusted life years (DALY) lost in 20052. The challenges caused by chronic diseases are predicted to increase in severity in the foreseeable future4,5. Unfortunately, China has performed poorly in addressing non-communicable diseases6, and rural areas have experienced the heaviest burden of chronic disease7.Since the implementation of the New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (NRCMS) in 2003, the main goal has been to reduce the burden of medical expenses, in particular, for farmers who are inpatients with catastrophic illnesses, for which expenses are very high. Although the NRCMS was initially incapable of covering outpatients with chronic diseases due to limited funds, in recent years the minimum funds for each farmer have increased from 30 Yuan in 20038 to 50 Yuan in 20079, and to 100 Yuan in 200910 (US$1˜6.3 Yuan, Sept 2012). This increased financing has meant that the scheme now has the ability to cover some chronic disease expenses for outpatients, as these expensive outpatient services for are one of the main causes of medical impoverishment11. Reimbursement for chronic disease treatment is a beneficial supplement to the NRCMS’s main achievements.The NRCMS is currently organized at county level, resulting in relatively independent policy-making, with each county being responsible for deciding what is contained within its own benefits package. Research from other transition countries strongly suggests that diseases that are the major causes of ill-health should be included in community-based health insurance12. From 2006, a few counties started to provide reimbursement to outpatients with chronic diseases, with an increasing number of counties offering reimbursement from 2008 on. Certain provinces, including Anhui, Yunan and Guangxi, have introduced a new policy in order to provide guidelines for the reimbursement of chronic disease expenses; however, not enough detail is included to assist with its uptake. There is still no national policy at present, and, as for research on NRCMS benefit packages, much of the focus is on inpatients13–15, and there are only few papers related to designing Benefit Packages for Chronic Diseases Outpatients (BPCDO)16,17. Our research compares the differences between the BPCDO offered in different counties in China, in order to measure existing inequalities and to produce a point of reference for national and county government policy decision makers.Benefit packages aim to focus scarce resources on interventions where they are most needed18. Benefit package design needs to encompass the scope of coverage and include the selection of services and providers, and the beneficiary obligations19. Finiteness is a basic characteristic of any benefit package; it cannot include everything, so identifying the priority medical services is the most important process step20. Some benefit packages are designed for particular populations or disease groups, such as HIV/AIDS prevention or maternal health interventions18.","10 Sep 2013","Approved","Qunhong Wu, Department of Social Medicine, School of Public Health, Harbin Medical University, China",NA," 1) The title of the paper is clear and outlines key information in this article. 2)The abstract has provided a concise and fairly good summary. 3) The description on the study design, method as well as the analysis of the findings are comprehensive. 4) The conclusions are justified based on the results. 5) The limitation of the data has been clearly stated within the article.

The pangenome of a prokaryotic species is the collection of gene families for the entire species, as opposed to a single genome, which is the set of genes in a functional organism. The pangenome diversity can be huge, which is also reflected in the span of phenotypes. An example of this is found in the model organism Escherichia coli8,9. Currently there are more than a thousand E. coli genomic projects listed10 and this number will grow in the near future, along with genomes for many other bacteria; it is reasonable to assume that pangenomics will attract more attention.The fundamental step in any pangenome analysis is the computation of gene families. Several approaches to computing gene families have been used in previous pangenome analyses1,11,12, but this part of the analysis has received little attention. A pangenome analysis typically involves the estimation of the size of the core and the pangenome, measured by the number of gene families, and several methods have been proposed for doing this1,11,13,14. The core is the set of gene families present in all genomes of the population. The remaining gene families are more or less abundant among the genomes. The sample pangenome size is the total number of gene families found in the currently available genomes, while the population pangenome size is the number of gene families we expect to see if every single strain was sequenced. It is the latter which is of scientific interest, but it must be estimated from the former. A fraction of the gene families will be found only in a small number of genomes, and those observed in only a single genome are called ORFans.The first step of a gene family computation is to obtain a list of protein coding genes for each genome under study. Completed genomes will have a set of annotated genes, but the quality of these annotations may vary between projects. A pangenome analysis will often include draft genomes as well, where annotations are lacking. For these reasons it is convenient to start the analysis by a gene-finding step, treating all genomes the same way, and minimizing variability due to different annotation procedures. Even if prokaryotic genes are in most cases simpler to detect than eukaryotic counterparts, there are still problematic cases15. In case of the draft genomes, where the genome sequence is spread out on a (large) number of contigs, the gene-finding problem is even more difficult. Ideally, we would like to compute gene families in a way that minimizes the effect of various gene finding algorithms.The second step is to group proteins into gene families. A gene family is basically the set of orthologs and in-paralogs collected from the various genomes. The most common approach so far is based on all-against-all alignments to compute some kind of similarity/distance between all proteins, and then finally cluster these. This approach poses some problems. First, the all-against-all approach is not computationally feasible in the long run since the number of genomes grows rapidly. Second, the clustering procedures always involve some granularity threshold implicitly defining the size/number of gene families. Some kind of thresholding seems impossible to avoid, but it would be desirable to allow it some variability over gene families, since some gene families are expected to be more conserved than others. Finally, false predicted ‘genes’ will not align well to any other, and produce singelton clusters adding, sometimes dramatically, to the total number of gene families found.When grouping protein coding genes, we find it natural to consider the presence of common protein domains. Domains are closely linked to gene function16. Previous work has demonstrated that the functional repertoire of a genome can be predicted by the knowledge of domain content17,18. In addition, focusing on the combination of domains in each protein, instead of the frequency of each domain separately, we come even closer to the protein function19,20. A grouping of proteins by function rather than by evolutionary distance seems like a good alternative, since pangenomics is in many cases about the study of functional diversity.The Pfam-A database21 is a comprehensive collection of domains, curated and of high quality. Each entry is characterized by a profile hidden Markov model, and until recently it has been quite time consuming to search against such a database. However, with the launching of the HMMER3 software22,23, it is now possible to search with all proteins within a genome against the entire Pfam-A database in reasonable time (few minutes), even on a laptop. The idea of using domain information in comparative genomics is not new, and Yang et al. used genome-wide domain frequencies to reconstruct phylogenetic trees24. Their study considered diverse genomes from both prokaryotes, eukaryotes and archaea, quite opposite of pangenomics, where we focus only on genomes from the same species. An argument for using domains was that structure is more conserved than sequence, and that domain information provides a view into ancient history24. In this perspective one may question the use of domain information for pangenomics studies, since they may provide too low resolution.In this paper we consider domain sequence families defined by the domain sequence of each protein as an alternative to gene families for pangenome studies. The domain sequence is the ordered sequence of non-overlapping domains along the protein. Clusters computed in this way will be coarse compared to previously used gene families, but are closely linked to gene function. We describe the procedure of computing such gene families, and consider the effect of gene prediction and of the use of draft genomes in the analysis. We use this approach in a pangenome study of the model organism Escherichia coli, the prokaryotic species with the largest set of available genomes.","06 Mar 2014","Approved","Barry L.

Such multisensory associative learning, particularly between the auditory and visual modalities, plays an important role in many social and cognitive processes, including object identification as well as lexical and semantic processing1–3. Multisensory processing is known to facilitate many aspects of information processing, resulting in faster motor responses4 and increased visual perceptual sensitivity5. Indeed, Barutchu et al.6 recently demonstrated that superior auditory-visual multisensory abilities were associated with above average general intellectual abilities in children. With regard to learning, stimuli that are initially encountered as concurrent and semantically congruent auditory-visual events are more reliably remembered than those encountered separately in the auditory or visual modalities7,8. Recent studies also suggest that sound modulates visual learning9,10, and that auditory-visual training compared with visual or auditory training alone can lead to marked improvements in learning11,12. Not unexpectedly, learning by experience and prior knowledge have also been shown to influence multisensory processes at both a behavioural and neural level1,13–19.Surprisingly few studies have investigated the differences in learning patterns within and across sensory modalities. Tanabe et al.20 contrasted the learning of cross-modal and intra-modal associations in an fMRI investigation. They assessed feedback-based trial-by-trial learning of sequentially presented novel cross-modal and intra-modal pairs in a delayed match-to-sample task. In their study, no significant differences between auditory-visual and visual-visual learning were found. On the other hand, Seitz et al.12 demonstrated that auditory-visual pairs were learnt to a significantly greater degree than intra-modal (auditory-auditory and visual-visual) pairs in a statistical learning task. However, the cross-modal advantage may have resulted from the method of presentation of stimuli whereby auditory-visual pairs were presented simultaneously but intra-modal pairs were presented sequentially. This systematic variation in temporal disparity of stimulus presentation may have influenced the results.Other empirical evidence indicates that concurrently presented familiar cross-modal stimulus pairs with verbal components can influence both learning and multisensory processes1,14,15,21. Indeed, verbal stimuli have been shown to facilitate many cognitive processes, including object categorisation and localisation22,23. This raises the question of whether visual-verbal learning may lead to behavioural advantages when compared with non-verbal auditory-visual learning in adults. The association and transfer of visual and verbal information are of particular relevance, as such associations are known to play an important role in the acquisition of complex cognitive tasks, such as reading24–26. Furthermore, in infants, linguistic material such as nonsense words can enhance associations between stimuli and contribute to categorical learning27,28. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has directly contrasted the learning of visual-verbal associations with non-verbal auditory-visual associations in adults.","23 Jan 2014","Approved","Trevor Hine, Griffith University, Australia","Author Response 29 Apr 2013"," I have read this submission.

Hosts can reduce the impact of pathogens through three non-mutually exclusive processes4: (i) avoidance of either infected individuals, habitats where the pathogen is prevalent, or of the pathogen itself5, (ii) resistance to the actual infection process or post-infection immune defences6, and (iii) tolerance7. Research on these responses has generally focused on animal and plant models, but there is growing appreciation that microbes, particularly bacteria, can exhibit similar responses. For instance, bacteria can be selected for heightened levels of genetic resistance towards infection by pathogens8–10. On the other hand, although bacteria are known to display plastic responses to various types of environmental stresses11,12 and to competition13, it is unknown whether they can do so when faced with natural enemies such as bacteriophages.Plastic responses are an adaptive phenotypic change following an environmental stimulus, occurring without a concurrent change in the genotype14. They may involve behavioural, physiological or phenological changes15,16, and be triggered by direct or indirect contact with the stimulus17 or through communication with neighbouring organisms18. Phenotypic plasticity is considered to be a genetic adaptation to variable environments, but given the diversity of associated mechanisms and behaviours, it is not known to what extent different stimuli translate into different responses15,19.Individual-level interactions between bacteria and phage may be conducive to induced responses. The first step of bacteriophage infection is the binding of phage proteins to bacterial surface proteins20, which then triggers conformational changes to both proteins21. Surface proteins used by the bacterium for signal transduction are known to be targets of bacteriophage adsorption22 and as such could trigger a response when bacteriophage binding is detected. Such a response would allow a bacterium to react to the pathogen and to eventually either evade or reduce the effects of the infection. Lytic phages are prime candidates for organisms against which bacteria may have evolved a stress response, because they typically interact with their host over short timescales, and death is inevitable once the phage has injected its DNA into a sensitive bacterial cell.In addition, bacteriophages are widely distributed in the environment20 and interact with their hosts over relatively small spatial scales23 and throughout most of the year24,25. This could select for the expression of induced structural, physiological or behavioural responses to different enemies. Also, bacteria employ signalling pathways and have a known ability to communicate within populations26. Such pathways could induce and synchronise inducible responses before predators and pathogens are encountered, or at least before they have spread through the population, or before the point beyond which cell death is certain. All of these factors suggest that plastic stress responses to phage should be a common feature of bacterial cells and that such responses would have important repercussions for ecological and evolutionary interactions between phage and bacterial populations. Although molecular responses of bacteria to bacteriophages have been characterized27, the behavioral, ecological, and selective consequences of such responses are not known.Here we demonstrate that when confronted with phage, bacteria express transient increases in division rate at a cost to individual biomass accumulation28. Specifically, we employ the rhizosphere bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW2529 to investigate how its population growth rate is affected by exposure to inactivated populations of is lytic bacteriophage SBW25F230. We find that bacteria exposed to inactivated phage increase their fission rate nearly two-fold at 24 hours post-exposure. This is followed by a continual decrease in fission rate relative to the control. We also show that bacteria exposed to inactivated phage were smaller in size compared to controls. By the end of the experiment, bacteria regained their original growth rate, but not their original size, which implies differences in energy allocation constraints between these two life-history traits. All of these effects were enhanced as the density of inactivated phage was increased. The results are consistent with a behavioural strategy that increases allocation to reproduction under stressful conditions (i.e., “terminal investment”).

The activation of Akt leads to the phosphorylation and regulation of a wide spectrum of substrates involved in multiple cellular processes, including cell survival, growth, differentiation, cell cycle progression, proliferation and metabolism1. The expression of a constitutively active form of Akt (myr-Akt) in transgenic mice was reported to influence thymocyte selection, lead to accumulation of CD4+ T cells in peripheral lymphoid organs, and to enhance T cell survival in the presence of various apoptosis-inducing stimuli2. We have previously studied the role of the Akt kinase in T cells, and most recently showed that a subset of NF-<U+03BA>B-dependent genes required Akt for optimal upregulation during T cell activation3. Studies of individual transcription factors and their target genes have uncovered numerous aspects of Akt signaling in T cells, including regulation of not only NF-<U+03BA>B, but also FOXO and NFAT4–9. However, the overall gene expression program controlled by Akt signaling in activated helper T cells has not been elucidated. Mapping global changes in gene expression has proven extremely useful in revealing previously unappreciated connections between groups of expressed genes and biological events, such as development and tumorigenesis. A study from the Cantrell lab10 concluded that the chief role of Akt in CD8+ cytotoxic T cells is to control the transcriptional programs that direct effector versus memory cell fate. Nonetheless, Akt may not have the same role in all T cell subpopulations. For example, constitutively active Akt can stimulate the growth and survival of CD4+ T cells but not CD8+ T cells11,12.In the current study, we tested the effects of a selective, allosteric inhibitor of Akt1 and Akt2 (Akti1/2)13–16 on activated T cells and further explored potential mechanism of action of Akt, by performing network analysis of gene expression data and validating the expression changes of selected genes by real-time qPCR analysis. Our findings demonstrate that Akt inhibition by Akti1/2 significantly affects ribosomal protein expression and the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction gene expression axis. Asthma and the antigen receptor signaling pathways were also impaired by Akti1/2 in activated T cells. Moreover, Akt inhibition decreased the enrichment of NF-<U+03BA>B- and Myc-targeted genes after CD3/CD28 stimulation. These effects may contribute to the functions of dysregulated Akt activation in tumorigenesis, as well as in normal T cell activation and development12.The importance of Akt for T cell activation and transformation led us to explore the underlying pathways and mechanisms (or target genes and downstream cellular pathways) by a genome-wide gene expression profiling approach. Therefore the aims of the present study were to (1) identify, at the genome-wide level, the genes that are differentially expressed in activated Th2 helper T cells, with or without Akt inhibition and (2) conduct bioinformatics analyses to identify the pathways and possible mechanisms involved.","04 Mar 2014","Approved","David Finlay, School of Biochemistry and Immunology, Trinity College Dublin, Ireland",NA," While some of my concerns that I stated in my first report remain, the authors have clarified most of the issues that I highlighted.

However, barriers to accessing these treatments include stigma, cost, distance, low mental health literacy, and long waiting lists2,3.Internet-delivered psychological treatments may increase access to psychological therapy4. TF-CBT has been delivered via the internet and has shown promise in significantly reducing PTSD symptoms in military personnel5,6, university students7,8, and community samples in the U.S.7, Holland9, Iraq10, Australia11,12 and German-speakers in Europe13. For example, in a previous study12 we evaluated an internet-delivered TF-CBT (iCBT) protocol with Australian adults with a primary diagnosis of PTSD. We found large within-group effect sizes (ESs) and small-to-moderate between-group ESs on measures of PTSD symptoms, depression, anxiety and disability, in a treatment group relative to a control condition.Time burdens on participants could hinder effective dissemination of internet treatments for PTSD. This study investigated the efficacy of internet-delivered EMDR (iEMDR) on the basis of meta-analytic findings showing that outcomes from face-to-face EMDR are equivalent to TF-CBT with the important distinction that TF-CBT required approximately 23 hours (SD = 11) of homework while EMDR required only 3 hours (SD = 4)14. iEMDR may offer an alternative model of remote treatment for PTSD to iCBT. The present study aimed to explore the acceptability and efficacy of iEMDR when used in conjunction with an iCBT protocol (iCBT/iEMDR course), and evaluated using an open trial design. To increase generalizability of results, inclusion criteria were consistent with those of outpatient services. The primary hypothesis was that the iCBT/iEMDR course would be associated with significant improvements in PTSD symptoms, depression, anxiety, distress, and disability.Secondary hypotheses were that the treatment would be rated as acceptable to participants and would not be associated with adverse events.","04 Mar 2014","Approved","Alyssa Boasso, Veterans Affairs Medical Center Boston, USA","Author Response 24 Mar 2013"," I have read this submission.

In 1994, 20,000 United Nations delegates with member status pressed for men’s involvement in reproductive health. The programme of action of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) stressed men’s shared responsibility for women’s health1. Although the primary focus was on reducing violence against women and children, the resolution clearly declared that men should take responsibility for the empowerment of women.Studies on family planning2,3, HIV/AIDS4, abortions4 and breastfeeding5 all provide clear evidence for the important and vital role of male partners in the decision-making process regarding women’s health. Interventional studies on reproductive health programmes targeting either males or both sexes, compared to programmes targeting only females, have shown a significant effect on the reproductive health outcome of women. With this growing body of evidence, the concept of men as “gatekeepers” of women’s health has been developed into a positive approach that includes men as partners in improving women’s health.Nevertheless, these involvements are often driven by the gender power relationships given to male partners in various cultures6. While reproductive health education and health promotion programmes that target adolescent boys and young men are acceptable in most parts of the world, shared responsibility for pregnancy-related matters heavily depends on the nature of gender roles within the society. In addition, fear of losing respect from peers, lack of communication skills, lack of knowledge, and perceptions of masculinity are also shown to have a major effect on this involvement. Despite having a lack of knowledge and involvement, men often dominate the decision-making processes related to pregnancy, especially in male-dominated South Asian cultures.Studies in maternal health have shown that early interventions during the antenatal period have a major protective effect for medical conditions complicating pregnancy and direct pregnancy-related acute complications such as haemorrhage, rupture of the uterus, and obstructed labour. These interventions include early identification, early treatment and behaviour modifications.However, screening tests and procedures for these conditions require resources, and early detection is not currently at an optimal level in most developing countries. We hypothesized that this could be partly due to a lack of awareness about maternal morbidity among pregnant women, and specifically among their partners who play a major role in decision-making. The knowledge of expectant fathers is vital to ensure that healthcare is sought early to prevent complications due to these conditions. The purpose of the present study was to assess the knowledge and awareness of expectant fathers about Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM), Pregnancy Induced Hypertension (PIH), and anaemia during pregnancy.","17 Mar 2014","Approved with Reservations","Shahirose Premji, Faculty of Nursing, University of Calgary, Canada",NA," I wish to extend my appreciation for the invitation to referee this important study which examines expectant fathers’ knowledge and awareness about pregnancy complications – gestational diabetes mellitus, pregnancy-induced hypertension, and anaemia – that may impact health outcomes of both the mother and baby. The relevance of the work undertaken is well articulated in the introduction and the authors used a non-experimental descriptive research design to assess expectant fathers’ knowledge and awareness about selected morbidities. Fathers were recruited from antenatal clinics at the Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital. Eighteen percent (44 of 246) of expectant fathers were unable to answer a single question (awareness and knowledge). The remaining fathers (82%) demonstrated varied levels of awareness about gestational diabetes mellitus (78%), pregnancy-induced hypertension (74%), and anaemia (63%) and knowledge regarding risk factors, signs and symptoms, associated complications, and management strategies. The findings have implications for Sri Lankan maternal health programme intent to improve health literacy of the population and strategies to promote health seeking behaviors.     Major CommentsIntroduction:Hypothesis: The statement leading to the hypothesis emphasizes health inequities (i.e. lack of resources related to screening and managing morbidities); however this is not the focus of the study. Moreover, the hypothesis would suggest that the authors wish to explain why some expectant mothers and fathers seek care while other don’t; asserting that lack of knowledge and awareness may be one factor. The way in which the hypothesis is stated would suggest that the study examines both expectant mothers’ and expectant fathers’ knowledge and awareness about selected morbidities. The descriptive nature of the study would suggest that you want to determine whether expectant fathers whose partners are seeking care have increased knowledge and awareness given their role in decision making about seeking care. Design and Methods:Setting: Provide a more detailed description of the study setting to determine how representative the sample is of the population seeking care at this hospital. For example, whether it is common practice for expectant fathers to accompany their partner (i.e. wait with then or drop them off) to the antenatal clinic, and the average number of women who attend the clinic per day, to give perspective for the short duration of recruitment (November to December 2010). Recruitment: How did you enroll the expectant fathers who dropped off their partners at the clinic? Your demographic description should indicate the numbers of expectant fathers who were waiting with their partners and the number who were dropping their partner off. Provide more detail related to the recruitment process (e.g. the number who refused to participate, language use, if unable to sign how was this managed, what were potential risks/harms and how did you manage these?). Questionnaire: Provide more details. The English version of the questionnaire uses medical terms (e.g., gestational diabetes mellitus, Polyphagia) which participants may not be familiar with. For example, in some cultures diabetes is referred to as sugar in the blood. When translating the English to Sinhalese, was the language appropriately changed? What was the level of readability in the Sinhalese language? Was the questionnaire back-translated to English to ensure language equivalency? Was the questionnaire piloted? Given the variability in literacy (i.e., levels of education) within the community, how did participants complete the questionnaire? For instance, did the researcher or research assistant assist by using an interview format? On page 3 it is stated that “The total number of answers provided by the expectant fathers ranged from zero to 33 (of 41 questions)”. The questionnaire shared in Appendix 1 only has 23 questions. Explain how each of the questions, particularly those with multiple components (e.g., risk factors) was presented and how responses were elicited.   Analysis:You indicate “All demographic variables were analysed as categorical variables”; however report the mean age of participants and their partners. Were data normally distributed to report means? Revise this statement accordingly.  Results:First paragraph: provide a brief description of your sample by highlighted distinct characteristics. For instance, for most women this was their first pregnancy. In the discussion comment on how your sample compares to the general population (i.e., how representative is it). Is it mostly first time mothers who access antenatal clinics? Did all expectant fathers provide demographic information? If so, include n of the sample in the table. You provide data on the prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus, pregnancy induced hypertension, and anaemia as reported by fathers (page 3 second paragraph of results). There are two issues with this statement: (1) prevalence refers to the proportion of a population. Your study used a convenience sample. (2) The estimate was based on fathers’ report but many of the fathers were not able to recognize these morbidities. Please clarify. Findings: need to be presented more clearly. The missing data needs to be accounted for in the tables and explanations provided in the text. Please explain how the percentages were calculated. There are instances when the total percent count is over 100% (e.g. GDM risk factors) and in some instance well below 100% (e.g. GDM complications). Did all participants answer questions related to demographic characteristics? If so, an important consideration would be describing how similar or different the demographic characteristics were between respondents and non-respondents. Examination of the distribution of responses based on specific demographic variables: Explain what you mean by “score totals”m and how this score was determined? Given the multiple comparisons being made, you are likely to find a significant difference by chance (i.e., Type 1 error).  Consider the p value adjustments required for these multiple comparisons. These findings should be interpreted with caution given the nature of the questionnaire (i.e., medical terms used), the type of design, and number of participants who were able to respond.  Discussion:The first paragraph discusses expectant fathers seeking health care and non-expectant fathers seeking health care, which is not the focus of your study. Delete. Needs more depth and breadth by addressing: Findings regarding awareness: was this what you expected given the policy changes (i.e., campaigns in the country) over the last 5 years? Why may the findings not be in keeping with what you expected? Lack of knowledge may reduce risk appraisal which guides health behaviour (i.e. seeking care); hence how do you explain the health care seeking behaviour of these couples? What else may be guiding their health seeking behaviors? The World Health Organization recommends 4 antenatal clinic visits – what is the potential implication of the finding of your study with regarding to compliance to this recommendation. Knowledge about selected morbidities: discuss every aspect evaluated (e.g. risk factors, signs and symptoms, etc.). What can be gleaned from these findings? Are similarities and differences? Would you expect the population have knowledge about management? Discuss the role of parity with reference to health seeking behaviors and knowledge or health literacy. Be careful with the inferences you are making. For example, improving knowledge will improve health seeking behavior. You findings suggest that expectant fathers seek health care for their pregnant spouse even though they don’t have the knowledge. Refocus the discussion with emphasis on the findings and implications for practice, future research and policy.  Limitations:Consider revising after you have addressed the above points. For instance, if medical terms were used, this may explain why so many respondents were not able to complete even one question. Quality of written English:Results and Discussion: a few sentences which are not clear. Page 3, last paragraph has a couple of sentences which are not clear. Page 7, discussion, first paragraph, second sentence and last sentence in the paragraph. Page 7, last paragraph beginning knowledge of GDM delete “because the knowledge of the direct complications in pregnancy associated with GDM was poor” as this does not explain the finding. Was there another point you were trying to make? Please clarify. Page 8, limitations, last sentence in the paragraph – not sure what you mean.  Minor Comments:Title: insert “selected” after knowledge of. Abstract: The results section may need to be modified after you have addressed the methodological issues. Language: change developing country to lower middle income (The World Bank income level categorization for Sri Lanka). Tables and Figures: Ensure all abbreviations are written out in full at the bottom. Figures 1-5: present in the order in which they are discussed in the text.   I have read this submission. I believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard, however I have significant reservations, as outlined above.

Due to the fact that we sense the 3D visual world through an analysis of 2D retinal images, the process of size perception is intrinsically ambiguous. As a result, the perception of an object’s size arises from the integration of multiple sources of visual information including the size of its retinal image, its perceived distance1, and its size relative to other objects in the visual scene2,3. These constructive processes are revealed through a number of classic size illusions such as the Ebbinghaus Illusion4 (Figure 1A), the Delboeuf Illusion5,6 (Figure 1B), the Müller-Lyer Illusion7 (Figure 1C) and several others that illustrate how mechanisms that underlie size constancy sometimes lead to illusory percepts resulting from a discrepancy between retinal and perceived size. In each of these illusions, the perceived size of an explicitly defined object is influenced by the context in which it is presented. Most relevant to the current paper are the Delboeuf and Ebbinghaus illusions that demonstrate that the size of an inner circle is overestimated or underestimated depending on the surrounding context in which it is presented. Though several explanations have been proposed for these illusions, recent research demonstrates that the effect is largely determined by the relative size of the inducer(s), their distance from the target2, and in the case of the Ebbinghaus Illusion, the completeness of the surrounding array of elements8. Taken together, the balance of these factors determines the magnitude of the illusion and whether the inner circle is overestimated or underestimated.Figure 1. Notable size illusions: A) Ebbinghaus illusion, B) Delboeuf illusion, C) Müller-Lyer illusion.Here we address the question of how we perceive the size of an implicitly defined object–an array of elements–by introducing a novel variant of the Ebbinghaus illusion that we have named the Binding Ring Illusion. We describe the illusion and investigate the underlying mechanisms that lead to misperceived size. A basic stimulus that elicits perception of the Binding Ring Illusion is composed of a circular array of small circles onto which a larger circle is superimposed as shown in Figure 2A. The superimposed circle leads to an underestimation of the perceived radius of the circular array relative to an equally sized array without the binding ring (Figure 2B). To our knowledge, previous research on the Ebbinghaus Illusion has focused on the effect the surrounding elements have on the explicitly defined circle. Here we consider the possibility of mutual influence in that the inner circle may also lead to misperceived size of the surrounding array. In the following experiments, we investigate the magnitude of this illusory decrease in size and attempt to study the components of the stimulus that are responsible for the observed effect.Figure 2. The Binding Ring Illusion.Which array of circles looks bigger? A) The test stimulus used in experiment 1 or B) The reference stimulus used in experiment 1.In experiment 1, we demonstrate that the effect of the binding ring can be quantified. In experiment 2 we demonstrate that the illusion arises due to assimilation toward the binding ring9,10. In experiment 3, we investigated the effect of spatial frequency. Finally, in experiments 4a and 4b we investigated the roles of local configural features in producing the illusion.","23 Jan 2014","Approved","Dejan Todorovic, Laboratory of Experimental Psychology, Department of Psychology, University of Belgrade, Serbia",NA," The authors have taken into account my comments in the revised text.

One, the malignant cells form their own erythrosomes and later blood vessels. Two, these erythrosomes have a different metabolic need than other cells in the region, which become the food. Three, the 3 week time point, which is described in this study, and the set of processes that governs this transformation of tumor cells into erythrosomes/proto blood vessels based on fibroblasts is an important key to the subsequent presumed metastatic events. This is a very interesting group of insights and if for no other reason than to test further this hypothesis, this paper should be published. This reviewer agrees with reviewer #1 and #2, who point out that the experiments would be more robust if further experiments would be done to gather data at various time points or from different models. This is a fair point, and I too believe that more time points and different models would benefit this work however the current work, in all three papers being concurrently published represents a significant work. Perhaps the authors can address whether such follow up work, i.e., to increase the time points and to try this with other cell lines, is on-going.The authors point out other interesting findings including the following sentence “The underlying host muscle cells appeared normal whereas adipocytes were commonly replaced with lipid droplets.” Suggesting a mechanism by which tumors can feed on the host cells in ways predicted by epidemiological findings relating various cancers to obesity. If true, this would begin to elucidate a causal mechanism with the current correlation between some of the epidemiological findings.

Continue reading Magnification The article has been amended to include examples of images taken at lower power magnification. Figure 5 shows how the overall topography of each section was examined before focusing on the most interesting regions.  Implications for tumor metastasisIn the title of the amended article we have added the word “implications” to reflect the distinction between the new results and their implications more precisely. In other parts of the article that distinction is clear. The original findings (including the blood elements and tumor cells inside the vessel-resembling structure, i.e., the capsular vaso-mimicry) are described in the Results section whereas the implications derived from those data and their significance are placed in the Discussion section. For the reader’s work such implications may be most useful when they represent new ideas and envision new directions for the future research. Without hinting in the second part of the title on significance of the new findings some readers could miss the article despite its relevance to their studies. In situ ultrastructure only The issues addressed in our study are central in tumor biology and have been approached in many ways. However, without the type of validation possible by the in situ analysis of a particular living system at high resolution, the published work left many questions unanswered and created multiple controversies. Yet, our in depth analysis of the TEM images would not have been possible without the other approaches. We drew freely from the abundant experimental data accumulated in the literature regardless of the method used to generate them. The visual information from our work inspired logical connections between various kinds of earlier published data, often derived from various sources. Therefore, our conclusions and hypotheses do not rely solely on TEM. Our approach fills up the essential void; it “connects the dots”. The approach and the model we used are the strength of our study (as discussed in article III). The tissue ultrastructural analysis in situ brings together aspects of tumor biology traditionally treated independently: hematopoiesis, vascular biology, tumor metastasis and metabolism. Such exposure of the interdependence among those aspects introduces the tissue level into the general conversation on tumor biology at cellular & molecular levels. What a single experimental approach is depends on the definition. One can base the criteria on instruments used or on targets analyzed. Bridging the tissue and molecular levels, we used TEM to characterize tissues, cells, organelles and specific proteins in situ (immunocytochemistry). We used a genetically engineered, GFP-labeled cell line and the graft-donor mice. Intra-vital light and fluorescent microscopy helped to monitor the rate of tumor growth in vivo. The future belongs to this sort of combination of methods, i.e., the use of ultrastructural analyses in situ to validate other methods. One tumor model Even though our initial observations have been limited to the breast cancer model, there are some indications that the capsular vaso-mimicry is not unique to that tumor type. As discussed in the article, the structure related to the capsular vasomimicry (Figure 3) was of the same nature as the vascular mimicry first seen in melanoma [PM:10487832]. Such mimicry was subsequently found in tumors of ovary [PM:11290546; PM:11839501], prostate [PM:11813211; PM:12359755] and in glioblastoma [PM:20375132]. Reporting studies based on one tumor type in one animal model is not unusual. The phenomenon of encapsulating tumors with fibroblasts is common among various types of tumors, although not every encapsulation forms the capsular vasomimicry. The prominent fibrous capsule associated with non-invasive insulinoma in the mouse model of pancreatic islet tumorigenesis did not coincide with the invasive tumor type either [PM:12086849]. Unlike the monolayer, a thick layer of fibroblasts encapsulating the tumor did not resemble a vascular wall. Figure 5 in the amended version of the article shows examples of both. Quantitative data & time points Our goal was accomplished by generating unprecedented photographic documentation of spontaneous intercellular relations leading to formation of the capsular vaso-mimicry. The nature of the study was exploratory and observational therefore the results are qualitative. The images represented raw data, i.e. a direct demonstration of the phenomena that had actually occurred in vivo. The animals were not subjected to any kind of treatment except implantation of the tumor. The conventional thinking in terms of comparing treated and control groups over a period of time to measure an anticipated effect and to evaluate its statistical significance was not applicable here. The time progression was not critical either, as opposed to the embryonal growth and development, because the tumor never matures. In vivo the cells were responding to locally variable microenvironment therefore they were not functionally synchronized. Consequently a range of different stages of the observed processes could be found simultaneously within single sections. To illustrate our conclusions we selected representative images after careful analysis of many (several hundreds per mouse at various magnifications). One should keep in mind that the tumors were about 1 mm in “diameter” when viewed through a dissecting microscope. The photographed fields were selected, not randomly picked; therefore stating how many they were would be meaningless. We stopped the analysis when the findings became redundant and we understood the observed phenomena. In the literature the number of studied animals tends to be inversely proportional to complexity of assays. For example, one study had animal groups of variable size: n=18 for flow cytometry and n=6 for histology (PM:15883207). For electron microscopy studies it is common to use samples from small number of individuals (PM:20439620).

Both forms of the adverbs “ectopicly” & “ectopically” as well as ""phenotypicly"" & ""phenotypically"" are used by different sources. Another example of such inconsistency is the pair of words “tumor” & “tumour”. We leave the choices to the editor. Magnification The article has been amended to include examples of images taken at lower power magnification. Figure 5 shows how the overall topography of each section was examined before focusing on the most interesting regions.  Implications for tumor metastasisIn the title of the amended article we have added the word “implications” to reflect the distinction between the new results and their implications more precisely. In other parts of the article that distinction is clear. The original findings (including the blood elements and tumor cells inside the vessel-resembling structure, i.e., the capsular vaso-mimicry) are described in the Results section whereas the implications derived from those data and their significance are placed in the Discussion section. For the reader’s work such implications may be most useful when they represent new ideas and envision new directions for the future research. Without hinting in the second part of the title on significance of the new findings some readers could miss the article despite its relevance to their studies. In situ ultrastructure only The issues addressed in our study are central in tumor biology and have been approached in many ways. However, without the type of validation possible by the in situ analysis of a particular living system at high resolution, the published work left many questions unanswered and created multiple controversies. Yet, our in depth analysis of the TEM images would not have been possible without the other approaches. We drew freely from the abundant experimental data accumulated in the literature regardless of the method used to generate them. The visual information from our work inspired logical connections between various kinds of earlier published data, often derived from various sources. Therefore, our conclusions and hypotheses do not rely solely on TEM. Our approach fills up the essential void; it “connects the dots”. The approach and the model we used are the strength of our study (as discussed in article III). The tissue ultrastructural analysis in situ brings together aspects of tumor biology traditionally treated independently: hematopoiesis, vascular biology, tumor metastasis and metabolism. Such exposure of the interdependence among those aspects introduces the tissue level into the general conversation on tumor biology at cellular & molecular levels. What a single experimental approach is depends on the definition. One can base the criteria on instruments used or on targets analyzed. Bridging the tissue and molecular levels, we used TEM to characterize tissues, cells, organelles and specific proteins in situ (immunocytochemistry). We used a genetically engineered, GFP-labeled cell line and the graft-donor mice. Intra-vital light and fluorescent microscopy helped to monitor the rate of tumor growth in vivo. The future belongs to this sort of combination of methods, i.e., the use of ultrastructural analyses in situ to validate other methods. One tumor model Even though our initial observations have been limited to the breast cancer model, there are some indications that the capsular vaso-mimicry is not unique to that tumor type. As discussed in the article, the structure related to the capsular vasomimicry (Figure 3) was of the same nature as the vascular mimicry first seen in melanoma [PM:10487832]. Such mimicry was subsequently found in tumors of ovary [PM:11290546; PM:11839501], prostate [PM:11813211; PM:12359755] and in glioblastoma [PM:20375132]. Reporting studies based on one tumor type in one animal model is not unusual. The phenomenon of encapsulating tumors with fibroblasts is common among various types of tumors, although not every encapsulation forms the capsular vasomimicry. The prominent fibrous capsule associated with non-invasive insulinoma in the mouse model of pancreatic islet tumorigenesis did not coincide with the invasive tumor type either [PM:12086849]. Unlike the monolayer, a thick layer of fibroblasts encapsulating the tumor did not resemble a vascular wall. Figure 5 in the amended version of the article shows examples of both. Quantitative data & time points Our goal was accomplished by generating unprecedented photographic documentation of spontaneous intercellular relations leading to formation of the capsular vaso-mimicry. The nature of the study was exploratory and observational therefore the results are qualitative. The images represented raw data, i.e. a direct demonstration of the phenomena that had actually occurred in vivo. The animals were not subjected to any kind of treatment except implantation of the tumor. The conventional thinking in terms of comparing treated and control groups over a period of time to measure an anticipated effect and to evaluate its statistical significance was not applicable here. The time progression was not critical either, as opposed to the embryonal growth and development, because the tumor never matures. In vivo the cells were responding to locally variable microenvironment therefore they were not functionally synchronized. Consequently a range of different stages of the observed processes could be found simultaneously within single sections. To illustrate our conclusions we selected representative images after careful analysis of many (several hundreds per mouse at various magnifications). One should keep in mind that the tumors were about 1 mm in “diameter” when viewed through a dissecting microscope. The photographed fields were selected, not randomly picked; therefore stating how many they were would be meaningless. We stopped the analysis when the findings became redundant and we understood the observed phenomena. In the literature the number of studied animals tends to be inversely proportional to complexity of assays. For example, one study had animal groups of variable size: n=18 for flow cytometry and n=6 for histology (PM:15883207). For electron microscopy studies it is common to use samples from small number of individuals (PM:20439620). In all five mice that we used (in this and the accompanying articles) the fundamental cellular mechanism of initiating the vasculature formation turned out to be the same. Thus, the number of animals was adequate for the goal of this particular study. Increasing the number of sacrificed animals above the necessary minimum, just for the number sake, would be superfluous and against the animal welfare rules. Minor comments Dealing with images as raw data makes it difficult to find the right balance between describing what they show (and what the readers can see) and what they mean.

If we regard a subset of species as inputs, and make sure that the system always converges to equilibrium values by using weakly reversible equations3–5, we may transform these models into a set of matrices fulfilling the role of input-output transfer functions, i.e. a mapping from sustained input signal levels to steady-state concentrations for all target species6. Protein signaling functions (psfs) are a systemic generalization of individual dose-response functions, which are usually described by Hill equations7. In contrast to Hill equations, which are not available for enzymatic reactions, which only calculate relative concentrations, and which only work for one reaction in isolation, the psf system calculates enzymatic and complex formation reactions in a complex systemic environment using absolute concentrations6. In addition, the reaction times to equilibrium are calculated as delay values, and the dynamic shape (“transients”) is also available for further analysis.In this paper, we want to ask the question of optimality of signal transduction. From an evolutionary standpoint, we assume that any biological signal transduction system is constructed with optimized efficiency of signal transmission. Furthermore, we assume that cells have the ability to adapt to perturbations of protein concentrations and changes in extracellular signaling by reinstating signal transmission efficiency. In the following, we investigate this question using a biologically realistic system – beta-adrenergic signaling in a submembrane compartment of a mouse embryonic fibroblast for a single input scenario, focusing on a selected target species as relevant output or actuator of the system (Figure 1A).Figure 1. A. Biochemical Reaction System with Selected Input (red) and Output (blue) B.

Shown is the original model, optimization by delay, by RC,S, and by both.Experimental analysis of signal transduction systems has shown fold-change responses to changes in input8,9. Accordingly, input-output transfer functions usually follow the shape of hyperbolic (saturating) curves, which are equivalent to sigmoids for logarithmically scaled input6. In Figure 1B we show the effect of a knock-out (KO) for a RGS protein in an experimental assay in yeast10, and compare this with the effect in the model system11. We see that the effects of the RGS KO on dose-response signaling efficiency are robust across very different cellular systems.Usually, when we use a computational model to investigate perturbations, we only study the effects as reflected in the simulation. By utilizing optimization in terms of signaling efficiency, we can make the system itself adjust to the perturbation. In this way, we are studying signal transduction as a self-organizing system, which uses objective functions to adapt. This basic idea is extremely powerful, and could be used with different kinds of constraints on parameters, reaction times, etc. and with different, multiple input scenarios for larger systems. To explore this question further is of significant importance in assessing cellular health and functioning.","03 Jun 2014","Approved","Eugene Koonin, National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Institutes of Health, USA","Author Response 14 Jun 2014"," This article reports a new approach to modeling biological signal transduction systems based on the simple but important assumption that such systems have been evolutionarily optimized for maximum signal transmission efficiency.

Blends of HIPVs differ from those of volatiles emitted by intact or artificially damaged plants and are specific to plant species, cultivars and developmental stage, as well as to herbivore species and developmental stage1–3. Natural enemies facilitate this specificity to find their victims. For example, parasitic wasps can distinguish between a blend of suitable host-induced plant volatiles and one of unsuitable host- or nonhost-induced plant volatiles to find a host4–6. Discrimination by the predatory mite between volatiles from plants infested with the prey and plants infested with the nonprey was also reported7. These plant-specific responses by carnivores may be due to innate olfactory preferences or to olfactory learning of prey-infested plant volatiles4–15.Learning is widespread among insects, and is relied on for all major activities16. Parasitic wasps are well-established model systems for research on insect learning17. Adult wasps can learn specific blends of HIPVs7–13,15. For example, Fukushima et al. (2002) reported that Cotesia kariyai (Watanabe) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), a parasitoid of Mythimna separata larvae (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), that were preconditioned by simultaneous exposure to infested maize volatiles and host feces showed increased responses to a synthetic blend of five HIPVs of low specificity (i.e., induced by both artificial and host damage)8. Takemoto et al. (2009) reported that Aphidius ervi, an aphid parasitoid, were not attracted to volatiles from host-infested broad bean plants over intact plant volatiles when they had emerged in clean Petri dishes, but when artificially exposed to infested-plant volatiles during emergence, the wasps showed a significant preference for infested-plant volatiles12.Cotesia vestalis is a specialist parasitoid of diamondback moth (DBM) (Plutella xylostella) larvae, which feed on crucifer plants. We previously reported that naive C. vestalis were preferentially attracted to crucifer plants with DBM larval damage over artificially-damaged or nonhost (Pieris rapae larvae)-infested plants6. More recently, we reported that a blend of four compounds in the headspaces of DBM-infested cabbage plants attracted naive C. vestalis14. The synthetic mixture was composed of sabinene, n-heptanal, a-pinene, and (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate at a ratio of 1.8:1.3:2.0:3.0. The attractiveness of the synthetic blend was confirmed both under laboratory14,18 and field conditions18.An intriguing question about HIPV-mediated interactions between host-infested plants and natural enemies is to what extent natural enemies can distinguish qualitative and/or quantitative differences between two attractive volatile blends in combination with learning. To answer this question, we qualitatively or quantitatively manipulated the synthetic blend of volatiles that attracts C. vestalis to DBM-infested cabbage plants. By changing the ratio or adding another host-induced component to the artificial volatile blend, we tested whether these differences affected the olfactory responses of C. vestalis via learning of plant volatiles associated with hosts or foods. To our knowledge, this is the first report to show the extent to which wasps can recognize/learn qualitative or quantitative differences in volatile blends by using a synthetic blend of HIPVs attractive to C. vestalis.","05 Mar 2014","Approved","Yonggen Lou, Institute of Insect Sciences, Zhejiang University, China",NA," I have read this submission.

This seasonal migration requires immense coordination of different systems including fattening, locomotion, orientation, and activity2. Several aspects of migratory behavior including onset, duration, intensity, and orientation are known to be heritable and to respond quickly to artificial and natural selection – indicating a degree of genetic control3–7. However, other studies indicate that both learning and developmental environments can also shape migratory phenotypes2,8,9.The propensity to migrate appears extremely labile on an evolutionary scale, with shifts between migratory and sedentary status independently arising, often repeatedly, in multiple lineages10–12. In recent decades, many populations and species are reducing the distance or frequency of migrations, and others are ceasing to migrate altogether, presumably in response to changing environments world-wide7,13–15. Understanding the molecular genetic mechanisms that regulate migration biology is imperative both for 1) understanding the evolutionary processes of behavioral adaptation and diversification, and 2) conserving and managing the phenomenon of animal migrations in the face of ongoing environmental change. However, relatively few studies have addressed the molecular genetic mechanisms of migration16. Our goal in this study was to build upon previous candidate gene studies to determine whether or not similar genetic mechanisms explain variation in migratory propensity at the level of individuals, populations, and species across taxa.Previous studies have identified a number of candidate genes that may be involved in regulating migration, with particular focus on circadian rhythm genes. For example, the gene CLOCK controls several aspects of the circadian rhythm in mice17, and in the blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus) it varies across latitudinal clines18, and with timing of breeding19. In salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.), CLOCK microsatellite repeat length also varies geographically and predicts migratory timing20–22. Monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) use CLOCK as part of the circadian pathway that guides their annual migration23, suggesting that CLOCK may play a role in the timing of migration across vertebrate and invertebrate lineages. However, blackcaps (Sylvia atricapilla24) bluethroats (Luscinia svecica18), and swallows of the genus Tachycineta25 do not show such correlations between this CLOCK polymorphism and migratory behavior or geographic location, despite possessing genetic variation at the locus. Furthermore, barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) show substantial variation in migratory phenotype, but very little variation at this CLOCK polymorphism26.In another gene, adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide 1 (ADCYAP1), length of a microsatellite repeat predicts migratory propensity of both populations and individuals in blackcaps24. ADCYAP1 is expressed throughout the brain and body of vertebrates27 and encodes pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) (reviewed in28). PACAP is involved in many diverse behavioral and physiological phenotypes, including the circadian system (reviewed by Vaudry et al.28). Specifically, in chickens (Gallus gallus), PACAP directly activates CLOCK and other circadian genes in the pineal gland29. Further, PACAP stimulates release of melatonin30, and is a key component in entraining the circadian system to the light-dark cycle31, suggesting that it may be involved in circannual rhythms that rely on sensing day length, such as migration. Additionally, PACAP is involved in a large number of physiological and behavioral effects, from feeding behavior to breathing28, many of which may be related to physiological changes involved in migration24.The body of work to date thus indicates that certain genes are associated with migratory phenotype in some way across phyla and within classes. However, these findings also warrant further study of the genetics of this complex phenotype at multiple levels in independent systems to determine whether selection is using conserved genetic machinery to arrive at similar phenotypic outcomes (e.g., Korsten et al.32).Here, we examined allelic variation in both CLOCK and ADCYAP1 in the genus Junco at the levels of species, populations, and individuals. The junco species group is currently comprised of the yellow-eyed junco (J. phaeonotus) and the dark-eyed junco (J. hyemalis), each of which contains multiple subspecies and populations showing a wide range of migratory behaviors33–35. Several of these subspecies have been identified as distinct species in the past (e.g. Miller35) and investigations into the genetic structure and systematics of the group are ongoing (e.g. Milá et al.36, McCormack et al.37, Rasner et al.38 and Whittaker et al.39).The various dark-eyed junco subspecies offer an especially exciting opportunity to investigate migratory differences between closely related populations. There are 15 subspecies comprising the species34, and genetic similarity indicates that these closely related forms may have radiated just within the last 10,000 years–spreading across North America following the most recent glacial maximum36. This rapid diversification has limited the ability to identify clear phylogenetic patterns within the species36. These subspecies and populations differ markedly in migratory phenotype, ranging from completely sedentary to those that migrate thousands of kilometers (Table 1), with several populations also exhibiting individual variation in migratory behavior in which some individuals migrate and others do not12,34,35,40. Further, a coastal population of the Oregon junco (J. h. thurberi) has diverged from a montane altitudinal migrant population in the last 30 years and become sedentary in a milder environment on the campus of the University of California in San Diego41,42.Table 1. Sampled populations and assigned migratory scores.Group categories follow generally from distinct groups of subspecies or unique forms as discussed by Milá et al. (2007)36 or Nolan et al. (2002)34. Subspecies designations follow Miller (1941)35 as summarized by Nolan et al. (2002)34 and Sullivan et al. (1999)33; dark-eyed subspecies are noted as J. h. spp. and yellow-eyed subspecies as J. p. spp. Migratory Behavior codes indicate the range of migratory behaviors inferred from breeding and wintering distributions, as follows: LD2 = long distance II, at minimum 1600 km up to 5600 km, depending on migratory connectivity; LD1 = long distance I, likely 400–700 km, possibly up to 5000 km, depending on migratory connectivity; R = regional, typically greater than 200 km; A = altitudinal, typically less than 200 km; P = apparent partial migration documented; F = apparent facultative migration documented; S = sedentary (see text for references).

We also predicted that allele length would positively covary with individual variation in migratory restlessness within populations.","13 May 2013","Approved","Roi Dor, Ecology & Evolutionary Biology, University of Colorado Boulder, USA",NA," Peterson and co-authors have investigated the association between genotypes of two candidate genes (Clock and ADCYAP1) and migratory behaviour in the avian genus Junco. They examined this association among subspecies, populations and individuals. Previous studies have found contradicting results regarding the association between phenotypic variation and genotype of these genes; therefore, more similar studies are required in order to determine the generality of this relationship and the role of these genes.The authors have sampled and analysed a large number of individuals and populations and analysed the data adequately. Unfortunately, the results are mostly negative and prevent from reaching clear-cut conclusions regarding Clock or ADCYAP1 and migratory propensity. However, studying the relationship between genotypes and phenotypes on several levels (subspecies, population, and individuals) enabled performing interesting comparisons and detecting some positive patterns.The authors have properly discussed the results and potential explanations and mechanisms for the differences found among the levels examined.I agree with the authors that correlating genomes with phenotypic variation may be the next step to identify potential candidate genes that may have a role in complicated behaviours such as migration.Despite the mostly negative results, I believe that this nicely-written paper provides a fine contribution to the literature.One technical comment – it would be interesting to learn the nature of the ADCYAP1 alleles that are just one base-pair apart.

At present, the Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Diseases (GOLD) divides patients into categories of mild, moderate, severe and very severe based on the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1). This classification has been shown to predict outcome and has been pivotal in guiding treatment of the disease3.The progression of COPD has classically been determined by the change of the FEV1 over time, usually measured over years. Indeed, the duration of the large trials that have evaluated the effect of pharmacological or surgical benefits in patients with COPD have ranged from 2 to 4 years4–7. It follows that defining disease activity or response to therapy with validated biomarkers that reflect disease progression would make potential future interventions easier to evaluate. Several studies have reviewed the roles of different potential biomarkers in COPD8. Our group has recently shown that serum levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) were higher and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) lower in patients with severe and very severe COPD compared with smoker and non-smoker controls without airflow obstruction9. Furthermore, the levels correlated with several phenotypic expressions of the disease including exercise capacity, quality of life, exacerbation and mortality9. Data from the ECLIPSE investigators, who studied a larger cohort of COPD patients, showed that several biomarkers correlated with baseline FEV1 but only one correlated with rate of decline in FEV1, the Clara-Cell Protein 16 (CC-16)10. While there is no question that a biomarker would be of great importance in COPD, the sample site having the greatest yield has not been clearly defined11.Blood from the systemic circulation returns to the lung for gas exchange and, theoretically, the presence of biomarkers could be modified during the transient time blood spends in the pulmonary vessels. Arterial blood should provide a more direct window to events occurring in the lungs than venous blood, which is perhaps more reflective of events happening in the capillary bed of the organ/tissues that it supplies. This is most evident in the significant differences that exist between arterial and venous blood gas measurements.We conducted this pilot study to test the hypothesis that in patients with COPD (a primary disease of the lungs) there is a difference in serum concentrations of the biomarkers MMP-9, VEGF-A and IL-6 between simultaneously collected arterial and venous blood. Further, we compared the results with similar samples from patients without airflow obstruction that served as controls.","07 Jun 2013","Approved","Hajime Takizawa, Department of Respiratory Medicine, University of Tokyo Graduate School of Medicine, Japan","Author Response 04 Sep 2013"," In this pilot study, the authors compared 3 potential biomarkers between arterial and venous blood samples among normal and COPD patients. Although the methods as well as statistical analyses are sound, there exist some limitations, as discussed by the authors; such as, small number of samples, unclarified differences between pulmonary arterial and venous blood, and limited number of biomarkers. I believe this study becomes a milestone for the future larger-scaled study for these important topics.

Its role in human disorders has been underlined by the findings of several hundred mutations in its gene, SCN5A, that are linked to inherited cardiac electrical disorders such as congenital long QT syndrome and Brugada syndrome2. In recent years, it has been demonstrated that Nav1.5 interacts with and is regulated by different proteins (recently reviewed by Shy et al.3). Many of these interacting proteins were also found to be mutated in patients with genetically-determined cardiac arrhythmias4. The generation of genetically-modified mouse models, harbouring mutations in the Scn5a gene, has proven to be a very informative approach to investigate the various human phenotypes that are linked to the genetic variants of this gene5. Since Nav1.5 interacts with many proteins during its life cycle in cardiac cells, it would be of great interest to generate a mouse model that permits the biochemical purification of Nav1.5 with high efficiency, hence allowing the co-purification of interacting proteins. The identity of these co-purified proteins may then be determined by using mass spectrometry-based technologies. In order to do this, one needs to first generate a knock-in mouse model, where a high-affinity epitope would be added to the mouse Scn5a gene that codes for Nav1.5.The goals of this short study were (1) to compare the biophysical properties of the sodium current (INa) generated by mouse Nav1.5 and human Nav1.5 constructs expressed in HEK293 cells, and (2) to investigate the possible alterations of the biophysical properties of human Nav1.5 constructs that were modified with specific epitopes. We used the common fluorescent GFP and YFP proteins as epitopes, which provide the advantage of being detectable without the use of antibodies. However, these tags can only be added to the N- and C-termini, which are both intracellular in Nav1.5, and which are thus, not easily accessible. Therefore, we additionally chose the FLAG-epitope (Sigma-Aldrich), which consists of a short sequence that can be inserted into the extracellular loops of Nav1.5. The results of these studies will have to be taken into account when planning the generation of a mouse line bearing an epitope-tagged Nav1.5 channel.","20 Jan 2014","Approved","Céline Fiset, Faculty of Pharmacy, Centre de Recherche de l’Institut de Cardiologie de Montréal, Université de Montréal, Canada",NA," I have read this submission.

The heavy and light chain immunoglobulin (Ig) genes that encode the components of the antibody molecule result initially from the stochastic intrachromosomal rearrangement of gene segments arrayed in libraries of such gene segments1. These genes are further modified after the activation of the B cells that possess them through somatic hypermutation targeted to the rearranged Ig genes2. Those B cells whose Ig genes encode molecules with greater affinity for the eliciting antigen gain a proliferative and survival advantage. In this way, the overall affinity of the pool of serum antibodies increases, sometimes by two or more orders of magnitude. This affinity maturation3 is an essential component of the establishment of humoral immunity, the basis for the large majority of successful vaccines4.A great deal has been learned about affinity maturation, particularly with regard to the mechanism of somatic hypermutation5 and the dynamic organization of the cellular environment in which affinity maturation takes place6,7 (see the recent review by Shlomchik and Weisel8), but the mechanism underlying the selective aspects of affinity maturation remains poorly understood. There is increasing interest in the manipulation of affinity maturation pathways in vaccinology9 and thus in comparing the biophysical properties of mature antibodies to those of their inferred unmutated ancestors (UA)10–18. Little attention has been paid, however, to the uncertainties inherent in the inference of these UAs. Given the sensitive dependence of antibody-antigen interactions on single amino acid changes19, estimating these uncertainties is essential. Under some circumstances, there may be more than one history consistent with prior knowledge that is supported by the data; having the means to determine these cases and provide a set of alternative UAs that as an ensemble cover a significant posterior probability could be valuable, as was shown by Alam et al. in a study of the affinity maturation of a broadly neutralizing anti-HIV-1 antibody14.The inference of ancestral rearrangements involves the alignment of two (light chain) or three (heavy chain) gene segments in tandem to the target mature Ig gene. The identities of the gene segments are not known in advance. Instead, there is a library of gene segments from which each segment is drawn stochastically; the identity of each segment is part of the inference. The problem is complicated by randomness in the location of the recombination points, where each gene segment begins or ends, because this condition implies that the alignments are not independent. Further challenges are encountered by the presence of nontemplated (N-) nucleotides added at random to the junctions between gene segments, and of course, by point mutations.There is a well-developed literature on ancestor reconstruction in phylogenetics (see, for example, Pagel et al., 200420). This line of research has informed the development of my methods, but the problem at hand requires tools beyond those that have been developed by its practitioners. The difference between the previous phylogenetic methods and the method described here is that the former do not take into account the complex process through which the Ig ancestor is constructed. This process places a strong statistical constraint on what ancestral states are permissible. My method owes a great deal to this prior work but does not aim to improve upon it fundamentally. It simply extends a small part of its methods to a new domain of application.Independent of this previous work from phylogenetics there are applied methods developed by computational immunologists. Indeed, computational methods developed to address the problem have been used for some time21. There are several different approaches and corresponding programs available online for carrying out these analyses, including iHMMune22, V-Quest23, Joinsolver24, and SoDA and SoDA225,26. None of these applications, however, provides either of two features essential for the systematic reconstruction of clonal histories. First, one must be able to use all of the information available in a set of clonally related Ig genes in a statistically principled manner. All currently available Ig alignment tools work with one sequence at a time. Second, one needs systematic uncertainty estimates on the UA. In order to say anything of interest about the UA and the clonal history, there must be some level of certainty that the inferred sequence really is the actual UA.The method described here provides these features. It is based on a hierarchical model of Ig gene development that produces an analysis of the clonal history and posterior probabilities on the UA. The method uses the information available across all members of a clone in a consistent and powerful manner.","23 Apr 2013","Approved","James Crowe Jr, Vanderbilt School of Medicine, Vanderbilt University, USA","Author Response 14 Apr 2015"," Current high throughput DNA sequencing technologies, including those for amplicons such as PCR products of antibody gene transcripts, allow for the production of millions or billions of nucleotide sequence files. An intriguing finding that has emerged recently is that B cells of apparent clonal families encoding highly related antibody transcripts, representing what appear to be somatic variants, circulate in the peripheral blood and other tissues. After sequence alignment, it seems very intuitive to infer that highly related sequences actually derived in vivo from single B cell clones. However, as the author points out, there is uncertainty in the inferences made by alignment or conventional phylogenetic tools because of the nontemplated regions of recombined antibody genes, and the high frequency of somatically mutated residues in clones from memory B cells. Current computational tools for identification of likely germline gene segments used in the original recombination are reasonable, but currently there are not adequate tools to determine the likelihood as to whether particular recombined and somatically mutated sequences derived biologically from another less mutated sequence in the repertoire from a sample. This is the gap that the author attempts to fill with the tool described. This tool likely has significant limitations, but it is important that such tools be developed and tested, with comparison to biological experiments. As sequencing technologies become ever more efficient, it is likely that increased sequencing depth will allow experimentalists to ‘fill in the gaps’ of these types of proposed phylogenies, offering some level of verification of the accuracy of the inferences. Expression and testing of binding of antibodies in intermediate nodes of these phylogenies could be used to experimentally validate the relevance of the inferences. This type of work is already ongoing in several laboratories aimed at rational vaccine and antibody design. I am not a mathematician, so I cannot comment as to whether the statistical methods are really appropriate in this work. I can comment however that there are a number of limitations that arise from biological particulars of antibody gene repertoires that likely need to be accounted for in later iterations of this tool. The possible number and diversity of nontemplated junctional nucleotides is theoretically nearly infinite and position independent, but structural constraints limit the length and type of residues encoded in junctions. In fact, canonical structural configurations of the necks of the hypervariable loops (CDRs) likely limit the sequence diversity that can be observed in peripheral blood expressed antibodies after selection. I am not certain if these structural constraints can be used to constrain the inferred phylogenies generated, but that would be very helpful, since somatic variants are unlikely to violate the common structural determinants of the antibody paratopes in antigen-specific repertoires. Antibody genes contain more mutable codons than many other genes encoding proteins, so the likelihood of coding changes may need to be accommodated. Insertions and deletions occur with reasonable frequency in these genes during the process of somatic hypermutation. Some sequences that arise from somatic hypermutation stimulated by a foreign antigen may be eliminated due to autoreactivity or other selective pressures. I also did not see any methods for dealing with sequencing errors, which are vexing in this context. All of these biologic phenomena affecting antibody repertoires make inference of antibody gene phylogenies especially challenging.Nevertheless, I find it encouraging that new tools like this are being developed that can be tested, evolved and validated in this area. The sequencing technologies present the practical problem of inferring relationships between observed transcripts already, and laboratory experimentalists need practical tools like this for establishing limited sets of candidate genes to synthesize and study. As larger repertoires from more diverse sets of individuals are obtained, the relevance of these tools will become clear. It is especially intriguing to think that, with sufficient sequencing efforts, we may be able to define all possible commonly expressed antibodies and their phylogenies, not just within individuals but across populations.

To date only a few studies6–8 have investigated the impact of compromised retinal energetics and integrity on such growth, despite the retina being a highly metabolically active structure. Photoreceptor activity is highly dependent on aerobic glycolysis and the availability of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) energy resources9–12. In particular, an ATP source is needed to transport both the light induced changes in chloride, sodium and potassium ions out of the subretinal space (SRS) into the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the obligatory accompanying fluid coming from the vitreous humour en route to the choroid. The sodium- [Na] potassium [K]-ATPase (Na/K-ATPase) channel is one of the most important channels involved in osmoregulation and fluid transport, particularly in the retina13.Na/K-ATPase activity is responsible for approximately 30 percent of total energy consumption in the body, and approximately 50 percent of the energy consumption in the retina14–16. Na/K-ATPase utilizes ATP hydrolysis to maintain electrolyte balance, and the associated electrochemical gradient across the cell membrane17,18 and cell volume by transporting Na+ out of cells and K+ in at a ratio of 3:2. Na/K-ATPase is critical to retinal function, regulating the Na+ and K+ gradients associated with the dark current in the photoreceptors, action potentials in the ganglion cells, Müller cell neurotransmitter uptake, light adaptation19 and synaptic activity. In the light, the Na/K-ATPase maintains the high extracellular Na+ concentration in the SRS, while also maintaining the potential difference across the apical membrane of the RPE and consequently driving the transport of ions and fluid from the retina across the RPE to the choroid20,21. Hence, changes in the pumping mechanism and/or expression of Na/K-ATPase by the selective inhibitor ouabain would be expected to alter the nature of phototransduction and affect outer and inner retinal neurotransmission.Indeed, ouabain has been shown to affect the resting potential of the optic nerve, disrupting retinal metabolism and inducing spreading depression in neural tissue22, and to affect cell density and the thickness of the inner plexiform layer (IPL) 2-days post-injection, with horizontal and amacrine cells being the primary sites of cell death. The extent of the morphological changes has been shown to affect the electrophysiological profile of the outer retinal response to a light stimulus in a dose-dependent manner15,23. At low concentrations, ouabain causes selective destruction of inner nuclear layer (INL) cells and the ganglion cell layer (GCL), while inducing reversible swelling in horizontal cells, preserving the Müller cells and photoreceptors24. At higher concentrations, ouabain completely destroys the retina25,26.To date the functional consequences of ouabain injection on ocular growth and refractive compensation to optical defocus have not been investigated in great depth. A recent investigation examining the effect of a relatively low dose of 1 mM ouabain on refractive compensation in chicks wearing positive lenses reported that application of the drug prevented the development of hyperopia27. It was posited that this was due to the inhibition of Na/K-ATPase channels which then altered the nature of fluid transport across the RPE, leading to significant choroidal thinning and thus reduced refractive error. Unfortunately the effect of this dose of ouabain on photoreceptor function and general retinal morphology, choroidal dimensions, and on ocular growth and refractive compensation to negative lenses was not examined.Thus, the current investigation aimed to examine the effect of a 1 mM dose of ouabain on refractive compensation and ocular elongation per se in response to negative as well as positive lenses or no optical adjustment. We hypothesize here that injection of ouabain, and subsequent inhibition of outer and inner retinal Na/K-ATPase activity, would not only prevent compensation to positive lenses as reported by Wong et al.27, but also prevent abnormal ocular elongation, refractive compensation and myopia to negative lenses due to the inability of any retinal elements to detect defocus and elicit the required driving force needed to alter ocular volume. It is further hypothesized that there would be no systematic change in choroid thickness across the experimental lens groups due to the inhibition of retinal responses to light rather than as a result of active ocular volume reduction following ‘ouabain-driven change’ in fluid transport. Although ouabain would be expected to thin the choroid due to increased retinal adhesion28, this effect is likely to be attenuated by the dilatory effect of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) on this structure7.We also examined whether changes in refractive compensation and ocular growth were associated with altered outer retinal function (i.e. altered photoreceptor, bipolar, Müller and RPE cell function), as assessed by electroretinography (ERG), and retinal organization via histological and immunocytochemical analysis. Changes in the expression of the specialized glial water channel aquaporin 4 (AQP4) across the retina were measured in view of the previously reported association between ouabain and retinal adhesiveness and cellular edema28. This work led us to expect altered intracellular and transretinal fluid production in negative lens versus no lens conditions. Apoptosis-related caspase 3 expression was also measured to assess the extent of cell death across the retina at the end of the chick rearing period.","14 Oct 2014","Approved","Shanta Sarfare, Department of Ophthalmology, University of Florida, FL, USA",NA," The paper is well written and the results are properly analyzed and interpreted.An important control that has been performed but not described includes the PBS-injected eyes to demonstrate normal ocular growth at this age.There is no figure showing the AQP4 immunohistochemistry or caspase labelling, when it is discussed extensively in the discussion section.Figure 2 does not convincingly show increased swelling of Müller cells, and as such higher magnification images or specific antibody staining would be useful.The ERG a-, b-, c- and d-waves are not labelled in figure 3.

For example, ref. 27 is incorrectly stated as published in IOVS, whereas it is actually only available as an ARVO abstract. It is indeed difficult to assess mechanism of oubain-induced refractive compensation due to the severe retinal toxicity of the chemical. Perhaps the authors ought to try lower doses with minimal toxic effects to tease out the true effect of ouabain? I have read this submission.

Two of the strains are well described in their growth and photopigment composition: The type strain Acaryochloris marina MBIC11017 was isolated from the didemnid ascidian Lissoclinum patella from coral reefs habitats in Palau2,3 and was later genome sequenced4. The other strain, HICR111A, originates from swipes of coral substrate collected on Heron Island, Australia and was also genome sequenced5. Since its first discovery, other Acaryochloris strains have been obtained from Japanese macroalgae (strain Awaji6), from surfaces in a hypertrophic lake in the US (strain CCMEE54107), and most recently from Australian mangroves8 (strain MPGRS1) and stromatolites in Shark Bay, Western Australia9 (ssball1).The light microenvironment in natural habitats occupied by Acaryochloris spp. has a high contribution of NIR relative to visible light10–12 and such habitats appear to create similar niche differentiation with bacteria carrying specialized photopigments such as Chl d/f or bacteriochlorophylls10,13. The notion of a global distribution of Chl d and cyanobacteria in the genus Acaryochloris11,14 further reinforces the need to obtain information on the photobiology of Chl d-containing oxyphototrophs. Understanding the adaptive mechanisms in oxyphototrophs capable of using wavelengths beyond VIS is of interest as it provides information concerning the usability, stress levels and limitations associated with NIR-driven oxygenic photosynthesis.Of all biological pathways, photosynthetic electron transport is particularly prone to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to the very high (positive) redox potential of the primary donor of photosystem II, needed to oxidize water, and the low redox potential of the primary electron acceptor of photosystem I, needed to reduce ferredoxin; here, singlet oxygen (1O2), is produced by PSII and superoxide anions (-O2)/hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the Mehler, ascorbate peroxidase (MAP) pathway of PSI15–17. ROS encompasses the production of singlet oxygen, superoxide anions, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals (OH), all of which are derived through the local energization of O2. If not properly quenched by protective mechanisms, ROS can damage proteins, DNA and other cellular macromolecules, and this damage can ultimately lead to cell death. Known quenching mechanisms encompass enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and catalase or non-enzymatic antioxidants like glutathione, carotenoids and a-tocopherol (vitamin E)18. In plants, ROS and in particular1O2 production has been shown to occur at photosystem II upon illumination with visible light19,20. In cyanobacteria, shorter wavelengths such as ultraviolet radiation (UVR, <400 nm), are known to induce ROS, causing DNA damage, lipid-peroxidation and overall decreased photosynthetic efficiency21,22. To our knowledge no study has investigated the effect of NIR on ROS production in cyanobacteria.Relative levels of ROS can be estimated through measurements of e.g. gene expression23, ROS sensitive fluorescence probes24 and enzyme activity25. These methods provide integrated values of ROS production over incubation time intervals ranging from minutes to hours. In this study we used a fast and sensitive laser photo-acoustic gas detector26 that can measure the ethylene produced from the reaction of certain types of ROS with the substrate 2-keto-4-thiomethylbutyric acid (KMBA), previously added to the samples. Such near real-time ROS detection is valuable in determining the immediate effect of treatments on the physiological state and stress level within living organisms. KMBA is thought to diffuse into intact cells27 and, when supplied at saturating concentrations outcompetes other radical scavenging mechanisms. In the KMBA assay, the butyric acid moiety is known to react with the ROS peroxynitrite, hydroxyl radicals and peroxyl radicals28, resulting in the formation of ethylene, which can then be quantified. Whether singlet oxygen and superoxide anions react with KMBA and subsequently form ethylene has not been investigated yet. In other studies, KMBA has been used to test the antioxidant capacity of radical scavengers via their ability to inhibit ethylene formation relative to a control reaction (total oxyradical scavenging capacity, TOSC)28,29.In this study, we report the effect of light intensity and spectral composition on ROS generation, as measured in real-time using a laser-photoacoustic gas detector in three different strains of NIR utilizing cyanobacteria belonging to the genus Acaryochloris, including a new strain (named Acaryochloris CRS), isolated from phototrophic biofilms growing on dead coral branches collected on Heron Island, Australia.","05 Mar 2014","Approved","Helen Yap, The Marine Science Institute, University of the Philippines, Philippines",NA," I have read this submission.

Among the various neurotransmitter systems affected by METH exposure is the glutamate system, where long-lasting drug-induced changes are suspected factors underlying craving and persistent vulnerability to relapse4. Due to their dual roles in mediating glutamatergic synaptic plasticity and control of synaptic glutamate release, the metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) have emerged as therapeutic targets of interest in the study of drug addiction5. Antagonizing the excitatory postsynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) has been recently shown to attenuate the reinforcing effects of METH on a progressive ratio schedule, as well as attenuating drug-seeking behavior in rats previously trained to self-administer METH6. Selective stimulation of mGluR5 has been found to improve the rate of extinction learning in rats previously conditioned to the reinforcing effects of cocaine. This study investigated the role of mGluR5 in the behavioral changes induced by repeated exposure to METH, using positive and negative allosteric modulators of mGluR5 function in separate experiments.The consequences of chronic METH abuse are often studied in the rat model of behavioral sensitization, where chronic METH injections reliably induce an elevated locomotor response to a subsequent METH challenge, relative to rats with no prior history of METH exposure8–11. Through their interactions with the dopaminergic projections of the medial forebrain, mGluRs have been found to have roles in both the development and expression of psychostimulant sensitization12. mGluR5 has been associated with the locomotor response and reinforcement attributes of psychostimulants since mice lacking this receptor were found not to respond to or self-administer cocaine as wild-type mice13. While antagonism of group I mGluRs, which includes mGluR5, in subsequent experiments has generally failed to convincingly affect locomotor sensitization to cocaine14, the effects of positive allosteric modulation on psychostimulant sensitization have so far remained untested. We evaluated the effect of the mGluR5 positive allosteric modulator (PAM) 3-cyano-N-(1,3-diphenyl-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)benzamide (CDPPB) and the mGluR5 negative allosteric modulator (NAM) fenobam on the expression of behavioral sensitization to METH. We utilized doses of CDPPB that have been shown to improve extinction learning after METH [30 mg/kg15], and cocaine [60 mg/kg7], self-administration training, and doses of fenobam (10–30 mg/kg) that have effectively reduced drug-seeking in METH-trained rats in our laboratory16.","06 Jun 2013","Approved with Reservations","Sharon Rosenzweig-Lipson, Pharmacology & Physiology Faculty, IVS Pharma Consulting LLC, USA",NA," The present studies investigated the effects of positive and negative allosteric modulation of mGluR5 receptors on methamphetamine sensitization.

Evaluation of an additional NAM or a higher dose of fenobam would allow for a firmer conclusion on this point. I have read this submission.

The issue of diabetic hyperfiltration has attracted substantial interest because of the evidence that the occurrence of hyperfiltration may have some value in predicting the development of diabetic nephropathy3. This concept seemed plausible because of the evidence that hyperfiltration may be caused by increased glomerular capillary pressure and that intraglomerular hypertension represents a general risk factor for glomerular disease4. Despite the continuing debate about the reality behind the link between diabetic hyperfiltration and diabetic nephropathy, the issue of the causation of glomerular hyperfiltration has been intensely pursued in rodent models of diabetes. Among the proposed mechanisms responsible for diabetic hyperfiltration, relaxation of afferent arterioles in response to reduced input from tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) has played a prominent role.TGF is an intrarenal regulatory system that operates at the level of the juxtaglomerular apparatus, and that translates changes in NaCl concentration at a distal tubular site, probably the macula densa, into inverse changes of glomerular capillary pressure and nephron filtration rate5. Two different concepts have been advanced as to how TGF may be involved in the dysregulation of GFR in DM. One hypothesis argues that the primary process is the growth of the proximal tubule leading to enhanced water and solute reabsorption with the consequence that NaCl delivery to the macula densa decreases, the TGF-imposed vasomotor tone relaxes, and glomerular capillary pressure and GFR increase6. This “tubulo-centric” concept has been supported by substantial experimental evidence coming for the most part from experiments in rats with streptozotocin-induced type I DM6. Alternatively, it has been suggested that diabetic hyperfiltration is primary, driven by structural changes and/or by largely unknown derangements in the spectrum of vasoactive mediators, and that TGF serves as a mechanism that prevents the full extent of the effects of these abnormalities on GFR7. These two concepts are not easily reconcilable because vasorelaxation is caused by a normally functioning TGF in the first, whereas, in the second, vasorelaxation is TGF-independent and is in fact counteracted by it to the extent TGF is functional. This “glomerulo-centric” theory has found support in the finding that type I diabetic mice of the Akita strain without a functional TGF system, achieved by breeding the Ins2 mutation of the Akita mice into the TGF-less A1 adenosine receptor (A1AR) null background8, display exaggerated hyperfiltration compared to Akita mice with a presumably intact TGF9.In a recent extensive review of the complex issues surrounding renal function in diabetic models, it has been argued that the failure to detect a clear TGF relaxation in the Akita mouse model of diabetes might be due to excessively high plasma glucose levels and the inability of proximal tubules to enhance reabsorption sufficiently10. This may prevent distal NaCl levels from falling, thereby maintaining some TGF activation and preventing hyperfiltration. Even though this argument does not explain the exaggerated hyperfiltration in the Akita mice with the A1AR-/- background in which the absence of TGF makes variations of distal NaCl irrelevant, we have taken this argument as an incentive to directly assess proximal fluid reabsorption by micropuncture in Akita diabetic mice with both native and A1AR-/- backgrounds. While confirming the presence of hyperfiltration in the TGF-less diabetic mice, our data show that there are no measurable reductions in the rates of proximal fractional fluid reabsorption between WT mice and diabetic animals with or without TGF. We therefore maintain the view that, at least in this particular model of type I diabetes, TGF serves as a mechanism protecting against the development of uncontrolled hyperfiltration.","18 Mar 2013","Approved","Bellamkonda Kishore, Department of Internal Medicine (Nephrology), VA Medical Center & University of Utah, USA","Author Response (F1000Research Advisory Board Member) 02 Apr 2013"," The manuscript by Schnermann and associates entitled, “Nephron filtration rate and proximal tubular fluid reabsorption in the Akita mouse model of type I diabetes mellitus” addresses a critical question in the development of diabetic nephropathy. To address the critical question of the role of TGF in the glomerular hyperfiltration in diabetes nephropathy, the authors used transgenic mouse models.  Diabetic nephropathy in human patients is a complex disease and no single transgenic mouse model of diabetic nephropathy can perfectly match the human disease. Despite these limitations, Schnermann and associates defined well the problem they addressed, and used appropriate mouse models of type I diabetes mellitus and skilled techniques. In this context, their approach is well controlled and provided meaningful data vis-à-vis the problem they attempted to address. Thus, overall it is convincing to this reviewer that their conclusions are valid and acceptable to the scientific community. I do not have any major issues, and only present a few minor concerns.Although, the manuscript is well written, at some critical places the use of long sentences is not advisable to convey the meaning smoothly, especially to the not-so-experienced readers and junior scientists.It is not clear to me whether +/- data presented in the Table 1 represent SD or SEM. It should be mentioned in the Table footnote as well as under the Statistics description.Although the scattered data points show the trends, however, looking at the Akita group in Fig 1A, and Ak/A1AR-/- group in Fig 1B and 2A, it is clear that the distribution is not normal.  The Ak/A1AR-/- group has distinctive distributions as compared to the other two groups in these figure panels.  Hence, the data presented in Figures 1 & 2 will be better interpretable by including parallel box plots.

Certainly the question of whether an increase of plasma glucose into the diabetic range increases or decreases proximal tubular fluid reabsorption is a defined question that should be answerable, and the impression that even this limited question appears to be model-dependent is somewhat disappointing.The deviations presented in Table 1 are SEMs. In regard to the figures, we thought that by showing every single measurement we leave the issue of data distribution open.

Gram-negative rods, crucial pathogens in hospital- as well as community-acquired pneumonia, produce and release endotoxins which constitute lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Once inhaled via respiratory routes, LPS stimulate alveolar structural as well resident cells to release many kinds of bioactive agents such as proinflammatory cytokines into local microenvironments2.Recent studies have emphasized a crucial role for the lung epithelium as an important sentinel and effector system of innate immunity3–5. Upon infectious agents and their products being inhaled into the respiratory systems, activated lung epithelium may contribute to the regulation of the immune response as the first-line defense mechanism6. Among those defense responses, it seems important that alveolar epithelial cells express and release a variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines into alveolar microenvironments6,7. A CXC chemokine, interleukin (IL)-8, plays an important role in the acute recruitment of immune/inflammatory cells, especially neutrophils, to the site of infection in the lung8,9. LPS bind to Toll-like receptors (TLR) and thereby activate downstream signal transduction pathways which ultimately phosphorylate cytosolic I-<U+03BA>B kinase10,11. Then, I-<U+03BA>B is phosphorylated to induce free-form of NF-<U+03BA>B, which translocates into the nucleus. The NF-<U+03BA>B binds to its specific binding sites on the promoter regions and enhances the expression of IL-8 gene12,13.Increasing evidence has indicated that the expression of many inflammatory genes involves the remodeling of the chromatin structure provided by histone proteins14,15. Remodeling of chromatin within the nucleus is controlled by the degree of acetylation/deacetylation of histone residues on the histone core around which DNA is coiled. Histone acetylation results in the unwinding of the chromatin structure, which enhances the binding of transcription factors to their specific promoter sites on the DNA16. Nuclear histone acetylation is a reversible process and is regulated by a group of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) which promote acetylation, and histone deacetylases (HDACs) which promote deacetylation17,18. The loosening of DNA-histone interactions and the subsequent unmasking of transcription factor binding sites is controlled by specific covalent modifications of accessible N-terminal histone tails19. Among the four core histone proteins that comprise the central chromatin core (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4), acetylation processes on H3 and H4 seem particularly important in gene regulation. For example, Gilmour and associates20 found that acetylation on H4 played an important role in environment particle-induced IL-8 production in A549 cells. Viable Listeria monocytogenes-stimulated endothelial cells showed increased expression of IL-8, and that process depended on modifications of H3 and H421. Although the host response in pneumonia is characterized by massive cytokine production, and altered histone modifications have been observed in diseased lungs22, it is not fully elucidated how histone modifications contribute to innate immune regulation in the lung.In this study, we tried to determine whether Escherichia coli-derived LPS, one of the mainstream stimuli upon bacterial respiratory infection, altered histone acetylation/deacetylation balance, and to see whether the modulation of HDACs or HATs by their specific inhibitors (i.e. trichostatin A [TSA] for HDACs and anacardic acid for HATs) affected IL-8 gene expression and protein production in an alveolar epithelial cell line A549 in vitro.","11 Mar 2013","Approved","Shu Hashimoto, The Department of Respiratory Medicine, Nihon University School of Medicine, Japan","Author Response (F1000Research Advisory Board Member) 14 Mar 2013"," This manuscript is well written and conducted.

To cope with infection, each host has developed physical barriers that inhibit microbial entry and tissue homeostasis factors and immune responses that may increase tolerance or resistance to infection. Immune responses can directly target microbes and are observed in most species, from bacteria to mammals through a variety of versatile mechanisms that may be of a broad or of a very microbe-specific nature. In terms of immediacy and specificity, the immune responses have been traditionally divided into innate and adaptive1.""Traditional"" vertebrate innate and adaptive immunityDefence barriers, such as the physical barrier of the skin or insect cuticle, intestinal mucus or insect peritrophic membrane and the low or high acidity in the gastrointestinal tract are the first lines of defence against invading microorganisms1. In addition, innate immunity can be elicited as a fast and broad response against pathogens. Specialised immune cells such as macrophages and neutrophils can internalise and digest microbes initiating an inflammatory response at the site of infection or systemically to produce a hostile environment for the intruder. The complement group of proteins can also be activated to fight invading microorganisms2–5.Components of the immune system can exhibit further specificity and acquire memory of past infections. This evolutionary step, termed ‘adaptive immunity’, can only be seen in vertebrates and displays antigenic specificity, diversity, immunologic memory and self/non-self recognition. Adaptive immunity depends on innate immune responses such as phagocytosis and inflammation that trigger the utilisation of specific immune response on the invader6. Adaptive immunity can produce a variety of immune responses specific to antigenic challenges through a variety of effectors. Cooperation between lymphocytes and antigen presenting cells is the main mechanism of action, according to which naive B lymphocytes expressing a membrane-bound antibody molecule are activated when they bind to their specific antigen and divide quickly into memory B cells and effector B cells that induce humoral immunity7. T lymphocytes recognise cell antigens only from major histocompatibility complex molecules and proliferate into memory and effector T cells. T lymphocytes can be subdivided into T helper (TH) and T cytotoxic (TC) cells that are responsible for the tight regulation of the immune response and cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity (CTL)8. During a primary immune response, naive T and B lymphocytes become antigenically committed and expand rapidly in a process called clonal selection9. Immunologic memory can be attributed to these memory cells, which have long life spans and exhibit a heightened response during secondary exposure.The immune response of Drosophila melanogaster Drosophila is the main model organism for studying innate immunity among invertebrate species. Drosophila immune defences include physical barriers10, homeostatic factors11 and local and systemic immune responses. Three systemic responses have been described in the fly: the humoral response, melanization and the cellular response12. Similarly to other arthropods, Drosophila contains a circulating hemolymph with blood cells called hemocytes. These can be sub-divided into three cell types with different functions: plasmatocytes, lamellocytes and crystal cells12. Plasmatocytes, which comprise the majority of mature hemocytes, can clear unwanted cells and pathogens through phagocytosis12. Lamellocytes can only be observed in larvae where they encapsulate and neutralise larger objects, and crystal cells are involved in the melanization process12. The synthesis and deposition of melanin in the affected area is thought to play an important role in wound healing, captivation and encapsulation of invading microbes and production of toxic substances for subsequent microbial destruction12. Coagulation occurs to prevent hemolymph loss but can also trap microorganisms and facilitate their destruction13.The Drosophila fat body is analogous to the mammalian liver where humoral response molecules are produced14. Bacteria and fungi activate the Toll pathway indirectly via production of a “danger” signal15. In addition, bacteria and fungi induce the Toll and Imd pathways directly by the recognition of bacterial peptidoglycan and fungal beta-glucan via peptidoglycan recognition proteins and Gram-negative binding protein 3 respectively16. Upon systemic immune response Toll and Imd pathways induce the NF-<U+03BA>B factors Dif and Rel respectively, which in turn induce the expression of several antimicrobial peptides (AMP)17. Besides AMPs, plasmatocytes locate and phagocytose bacteria through the help of scavenger receptors Eater and Dscam18,19. The epithelial barrier also exhibits local immunity where production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and AMPs provides a defence mechanism in the gut20. In addition to the plasmatocyte-expressed cytokine unpaired 3 (Upd3) induces the JAK/STAT pathway mediating robust responses to bacterial and fungal infection12; while the same pathway can be induced upon tissue damage or viral infection21,22.Evidence of pathogen specific immunological memoryThe aforementioned innate immune responses have not been proven to exhibit adaptive properties such as memory or specificity. However, the classic division between innate and adaptive immunity has recently been brought into question by a number of studies in invertebrate organisms, which challenge the currently defined boundaries of immunological memory23.Recent evidence suggests that arthropods can display selected 'specificity' towards particular microorganisms. Pham and colleagues demonstrated that the fruit fly exhibits a specific primed immune response dependent on plasmatocytes24. They tested various pathogens including bacteria and fungi and found that flies mount a prolonged protective response against Streptococcus pneumoniae after being primed with a sub-lethal or heat-killed dose of the bacterium. S. pneumoniae bacteria are killed by the host within 1 day of infection only in primed flies whereas unprimed flies still contained bacteria indicating that survival depends on the elimination rate of S. pneumoniae24. They also found a similar adaptation with the natural fungal pathogen Beauveria bassiana.Protection against other bacteria was not observed by priming with S. pneumonia. Conversely, other heat-killed bacteria – known to be strong immune activators - did not exert a protective response against S. pneumoniae. Immune pathway mutants demonstrated that immune priming is due to the activation of the Toll pathway but not due to the expression of AMPs. These findings illustrate the selective adaptability of the immune system through the activation of Toll pathway and plasmatocytes. However it is important to note that not all pathogens respond in the same way. In this report, we use the example of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a gram-negative bacterium that induces the Imd and the Toll pathways, as well as the cellular immune response.Immune priming with P. aeruginosaPrevious studies show that live P. aeruginosa infection with the low-in-virulence CF5 strain primes the immune system and helps to protect Drosophila from subsequent lethal infection with the virulent PA14 strain (UCBPP-PA14)25. This protection is evident 6, 12 and 24 hours post immune priming and involves the activation of both the Imd and the Toll pathway25. Here we assess the duration of this protective response and the involvement of humoral and cellular immune responses. We find that immune priming with heat-killed P. aeruginosa CF5 confers protection for less than 7 days and that the Imd and the Toll pathways, as well as phagocytosis, contribute to host protection at 2 and 5 days respectively post-immune priming.","22 Mar 2013","Approved with Reservations","Bruno Lemaitre, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland",NA," This is a short paper on the influence of priming on the Drosophila immune response.The results are worthy enough to be published but require major improvements.1) The paper, especially the introduction, is poorly written. I just mention few problems*All the parts on the vertebrate adaptive immune should be double checked by an immunologist. Many sentences make no sense.Ex.: 'Cooperation between lymphocytes and antigen presenting cells is the main mechanism of action, according to which naive B lymphocytes expressing a membrane-bound antibody molecule are activated when they bind to their specific antigen and divide quickly into memory B cells and effector B cells that induce humoral immunity'This is a short cut. B cells are activated upon direct recognition of antigen and a signal coming from T cell that has been previously activated by a DC This is not a mechanism of action... • Intro part on Drosophila- (ref 11) is a paper unrelated to what it is linked ('homeostatic factors').- Can melanization be considered as a part of the humoral response?- What does 'captivation' mean?- The role of dScam in phagocytosis is poorly established compared to NimC1. I am not aware that Eater has been shown to 'locate' bacteria. - 'also exhibit local immunity': 'Also' seems weird when the part above discusses systemic immunity.• Intro part on specificity- Specificity has been shown. Flies activate adapted immune response to aggressors (ex. Toll/Imd, encapsulation only against parasites). This is not new. What is possibly new is the high degree of specificity.- What is the meaning of 'selected specificity' and 'selective adaptability'?- 'They also found similar adaptation': the term adaptation is unclear.• Boman, in his famous 1972 Nature paper, has already shown that priming with E. clocae could protect fly from an infection by P. aeruginosa. This could be mentioned.Figure 4: Eater is not a cellular deficient mutant but a phagocytic mutant. Idem for 'humoral response mutant' in figure 6. This is not precise enough.2) All the experiments in figures 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 should be repeated at least a second time in a way to have an independent repeat and a higher number of flies.3) The observed effect is not striking: improvement of only 2h. From my point of view, this actually suggests that priming is not very efficient and could be simply explained by the long-lasting effect of AMPs or other immune factors. This hypothesis should be discussed first before evoking dScam, other complex mechanisms or the concept of memory. The memory hypothesis of dSCAM is clearly not needed to explain the observed results. 4) Mutation should be better described and written in italic. Is there an eater mutant or are the authors using a set of deficiencies to generate a mutant?5) Figure 3: this author has already reported that Toll pathway contributes to host defense against P. aeruginosa. In this case, can they explain why dif mutant survives better than the the wild-type? I have read this submission.

Nociceptive fibers originating in both the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and trigeminal ganglia (TG) respond to a variety of chemesthetic stimuli1. In most mammals, nociceptive DRG fibers are protected from chemesthetic compounds by a keratinized epithelium2,3. Therefore, chemesthetic sensations are primarily mediated by trigeminal fibers that innervate the mucus membranes of the nasal cavity, nasopharynx, oral cavity and cornea. Additionally, chemesthetic agents can also stimulate vagal nerve fibers innervating the gut and respiratory tract. A wide variety of chemical irritants stimulate the polymodal nociceptors of the trigeminal nerve4. While our knowledge of the receptors found on these nociceptive neurons is expanding, the mechanism of stimulation is known for only a few of these trigeminal chemical stimuli. For example, capsaicin, a compound found in chili peppers, activates transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channels5.TRPV1 is a member of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family of nonspecific cation channels6, which were first identified in the Drosophila visual system7. TRP channels are found in a multitude of mammalian tissues and are of particular importance in sensory systems8. TRPV1 is activated by stimuli as diverse as plant metabolites, such as capsaicin5, eugenol9 and resiniferatoxin10; low pH5; temperatures above 43°C5; endocannabinoids, such as anandamide11; lipid-derived secondary messengers such as phosphoinositides12; and metal ions, such as Ni2+13. The channel is highly expressed by Calcitonin gene-related peptide- and substance P-positive nociceptive fibers originating in the DRG and TG14. In addition to TRPV1 and TRPV family members 2–4, the nociceptive Ad and C fibers of the trigeminal nerve also express TRP ankyrin 1 (TRPA1), TRP melastatin 8 (TRPM8), acid sensing ion channels (ASIC) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR)2, which mediate chemical sensitivity to allyl isothiocyanate15, menthol16, acids17,18 and nicotine19.Fibers from the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve, cranial nerve V1, innervate the most rostral portion of the airway. Stimulation of these fibers results in protective airway reflexes, including coughing, vasodilation and decreased respiration rate1,20,21. Chemesthetic compounds activate the trigeminal nerve either through direct stimulation of free nerve endings or by stimulation of solitary chemosensory cells. However, TRPV1 is found only on the free nerve ends and not on solitary chemosensory cells3,21,22.These facts support the concept that the trigeminal system is a warning system tuned to be responsive to diverse classes of potentially dangerous substances23. As would be expected in such a warning system, the trigeminal system exhibits many aspects of redundancy, such as the presence of three different receptors that are sensitive to low pH: TRPV1, TRPA1 and ASIC18 and responsiveness to very different chemical stimuli, indicated by the presence of multiple broadly tuned receptor proteins, such as TRPV1 and TRPA1. Much of the difficulty in determining the mechanism of stimulation of trigeminal irritants can be attributed to the redundancy and promiscuity of the trigeminal system.To determine whether TRPV1 is necessary for the detection of trigeminal irritants other than capsaicin, we tested wildtype and TRPV1 knockout mice (Trpv1–/–) in three different behavioral assays for trigeminal irritation. In one assay, mice were presented with a chemical via a cotton swab and their responses scored on a 5-level scale. In another assay, a modified two-bottle preference test, which avoids mixing irritants with the animal’s drinking water to prevent post-ingestive effects, was used to assess aversion. In the final assay, a custom-built air-dilution olfactometer was used to administer volatile compounds to mice restrained in a double-chambered plethysmograph where respiratory reflexes were monitored, this representing a modified “Alarie Test”24,25. Our data suggest that, although many compounds may activate TRPV1, only a few, such as cyclohexanone, are exclusively detected by the channel, a finding that underlies the biological redundancy typified by the trigeminal system.","12 Mar 2013","Approved","Gunnar D Nielsen, National Research Centre for the Working Environment, Denmark",NA," The hypothesis is that trigeminal induced (sensory) irritation of chemicals is due to multiple receptors, which is summarized in the Introduction section. Thus an irritant response may be due to activation of several receptors providing redundant detection of an irritant effect of a chemical. This study investigates the role of the TRPV1 (“capsaicin receptor”) in activation of the trigeminal nerve by seven substances (toluene, nicotine eugenol, cyclohexanone, capsaicin, benzaldehyde, amyl acetate and acetic acid).Mice with and without the TRPV1 receptor (wild type and knockout mice) were used. Each substance was studied in both types of mice by three methods: 1) Withdrawal from a cotton swab soaked in the compound;2) A two bottle drinking water preferred choice test, where the atmosphere around one of the bottles was clean air and the other was with the air containing the test compound, and; 3) A reflex induced decreased in respiratory rate due to activation of the trigeminal nerve, a relatively specific method.It was convincingly demonstrated that cyclohexanone was less irritating in all three test methods in the knockout mice which indicates that the irritation response at least partly was mediated by the PRPV1 receptor. In the specific respiratory rate test, the TRPV1 receptor was essential for its detection. The manuscript is consistent and well written.

In A. nidulans, extracellular proteases are produced in response to carbon, nitrogen or sulfur starvation4. Genetic evidence indicates that XprG activates expression of extracellular protease genes in response to nutrient stress and that HxkC and HxkD are negative regulators of XprG1–3,5,6. The hxkC<U+0394>1 and hxkD<U+0394>3 null mutations and the xprG1 gain-of-function mutation increase production of extracellular proteases1–3,5. In contrast, loss-of-function mutations in xprG abolish carbon-starvation-induced production of extracellular proteases and are epistatic to the hxkC<U+0394>1 and hxkD<U+0394>3 null mutations3,6,7. The production of an acid phosphatase in response to phosphate limitation and of extracellular proteases in response to nitrogen- and sulfur-starvation is also reduced in xprG- mutants7. Thus, there is evidence that XprG could be involved in a general response to starvation.XprG is similar to VIB-1 of Neurospora crassa, and both are members of the Ndt80 family of p53-like, Ig-fold transcriptional activators (Pfam PF05224)7. VIB-1 is required for expression of genes involved in heterokaryon incompatibility, a type of programmed cell death (PCD)8. XprG is also similar to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae meiosis-specific transcriptional activator, Ndt809. Ndt80 activates the transcription of more than 150 genes during the middle phase of meiosis and is required for progression through meiosis10. It has recently been shown that Ndt80 is also involved in resetting lifespan during meiosis and that transient expression of NDT80 extends the lifespan of aging yeast cells11.HxkC and HxkD are similar in sequence to catalytic hexokinases but lack some of the conserved residues found in the sugar-binding and ATP-binding domains1. In addition, both possess an extra stretch of amino acids within the adenosine-binding domain. Several plant hexokinase-like proteins that lack catalytic activity also possess an insertion in this same position12,13. The hxkC- and hxkD- mutants have similar phenotypic effects on extracellular protease production but the proteins encoded by these genes are located in different subcellular compartments1. HxkD is a nuclear protein and HxkC is the first fungal hexokinase shown to be associated with mitochondria. Binding of hexokinase to mitochondria blocks apoptosis in human cells and PCD in plants14–16.As meiosis in S. cerevisiae requires nutrient deprivation and genes expressed during heterokaryon incompatibility are also expressed in response to starvation, we have suggested that nutrient sensing may be a feature of all Ndt80 family members7. Previous studies have shown that XprG regulates production of extracellular proteases and an acid phosphatase in response to starvation2,3,5–7. In this report, we show that XprG has a wider role as a global regulator of the carbon nutrient stress response and is involved in triggering autolysis, a form of fungal programmed cell death induced by starvation.","08 Apr 2013","Approved","Michael Hynes, Faculty of Science, Department of Genetics, The University of Melbourne, Australia",NA," Carbon starvation is likely to be a common stress that fungi encounter in the environment. This group has previously identified the xprG gene, which contains a p53 like Ndt80 DNA binding domain, as being involved in the response to starvation. Here they have studied by microarrays the effects of xprG on the response to 16 hours of carbon starvation. They have verified some of the responses by qRT-PCR as well as physiological studies. Effects on glucose uptake, conidial and hyphal pigmentation, secondary metabolite production and autolysis were verified and are consistent with previous studies. The effects of an xprG gain of function mutation support the results. This work therefore provides strong support for XprG playing an important role in the response to starvation – a novel and significant result which adds to the large body of data relating to genes involved in development and secondary metabolite production in A. nidulans.A further significant result is the finding that a second Ndt80 domain containing gene, AN6015- designated ndtA, when deleted results in loss of sexual development.

The gut is home to millions of microorganisms and collectively this is often referred to as the “gut microbiome”1. This refers to coexistence of beneficial and pathological microorganisms within the gut flora, which under usual physiological “healthy” states are considered normal. Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) demonstrates this balance – many normal individuals carry this organism within their large bowel and yet exhibit no associated symptoms; however, when the more beneficial organisms are reduced, for example by use of antibiotics, C. difficile dominates the GI tract resulting in an acute diarrhoeal-type disease2. The prospect that we may be able to improve the natural history of bowel diseases through manipulation of the normal gut homeostasis between various health-promoting and health-endangering microorganisms is the basis of potential for the role of probiotics in health and disease3–5. Probiotics are defined as live microbial supplements which exert a beneficial effect on health and are non-pathogenic or toxic6.Recent evidence suggests that the presence of different bacterial species in the colon can have a significant impact on the immune functioning of the gastrointestinal tract and that manipulation of normal gut microbiome homeostasis can alter local immunity within the luminal gut as well as systemically3,4,7,8. Idiopathic chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis are characterised by persistent or episodic inflammation of the gastrointestinal mucosa and it appears that these patients are mounting overwhelming immune responses to non-pathogenic gut bacteria which would otherwise be ignored in the gut of a healthy host9. The gut microbiome differs significantly between healthy controls and IBD patients, particularly within the inflammatory colonic lesions, which are found to contain greater numbers of unfavourable bacteria7,9. Luminal colonic flora and the immunological response of the gut play a major role in initiation and perpetuation of chronic IBD7,8,10, although whether these alterations in gut microbiome are primary causes of the diseases or secondary phenomena resulting from the disease currently remains undecided.Probiotics are non-pathogenic, live microbial supplements which when taken on a regular basis, claim to offer an immune advantage by increasing the balance of health-promoting bacteria such as lactobacilli. Prolonged exposure of supplemental lactobacilli induces their translocation and adherence to human intestinal epithelial cells which are capable of activating macrophages9. Enhancing the immunomodulatory effect of intestinal flora to inflammation by such means is thus of great current interest for patients with IBDs yet studies supporting this theory are limited.The most commonly used bacterial micro-organisms are bifidobacterium and lactobacillus and marketing strategies promote these heavily on the basis that they will improve health and be of benefit to the gastrointestinal tract. For the past decade, probiotics have been marketed as food supplements, most commonly in the form of drinks or tablets, widely available without prescription from supermarkets or from internet sites. Thus, there is uncertainty about the prevalence of use within the general population and in particular amongst patients who suffer with inflammatory bowel conditions. We have hypothesized that these preparations would be especially attractive to patients with chronic IBDs: these conditions may require continued therapy with powerful immunosuppressive drugs and the concept of restoring the balance of bacteria in the gut with a food supplement is likely to be attractive to many people. However we do not know how many people with IBD are using these preparations. Although widely regarded as completely safe and natural, it is even possible that probiotics could be harmful: the powerful immunosuppressive drugs taken by many patients with IBD or the underlying disease could alter the response to these otherwise harmless bacteria, and rare cases of invasive systemic disease have been reported with probiotics6. It is now clear that many foodstuffs and dietary supplements can interact with prescription drugs and either increase or decrease the effect of these drugs10,11; other theoretical problems with probiotics in IBD include the possible transmission of bacterial antibiotic resistance from non-pathogenic to pathogenic bacteria and the generation of as yet unreported negative effects upon the gastrointestinal immune system6. Also probiotics have been shown to accelerate gastrointestinal transit and could induce diarrhoea or a change in stool frequency in an IBD patient that might otherwise be assumed to be a flare of active disease10,12.Despite the potential benefits or adverse effects of probiotics in IBD as outlined above, we do not currently know how prevalent the use of these supplements are. Neither do we know why certain patients may be taking them. Therefore it is important to determine how commonly these supplements are used in IBD and how interested IBD patients are in taking them. Furthermore, determining which are the main drivers of probiotic usage may shed light on issues with the current delivery of care. Probiotic uses may reflect a dissatisfaction with current therapies or demonstrate a positive interest in more natural therapies; thus we may be able to identify areas of need within our service and hence provide additional resources and support for patients. Despite the widespread availability of probiotics, there are relatively few studies examining the use of these preparations in the IBD population13–17, and in particular there is a paucity of information related to patients in the United Kingdom.We wherefore aimed to determine the prevalence of probiotic use amongst patients with IBD and assess which disease-related and demographic factors are influencing their consumption. As probiotics are relatively new “therapies”, often classified as complementary alternative medication (CAM), it is important to determine variables that may influence their usage as these may create bias in later studies seeking to quantify their overall effects.","09 May 2013","Approved with Reservations","Stephen Lewis, Gastroenterology, Derriford Hospital, UK",NA," I enjoyed reading this small study but it is clearly underpowered and has no control group making it difficult to draw meaningful conclusions.AbstractBackground: The second sentence implies that probiotics have an effect on gastrointestinal function, which contradicts some of the later statements saying that their effects are unsubstantiated. I would tend to favour focusing on the study and not entering into any discussion on the effectiveness of probiotics.Introduction:This is far too long and could easily be cut in half. Particularly the first paragraph is repeated elsewhere in the introduction and is largely irrelevant to the study. The grammar generally could be more precise. Materials and methods:I have significant reservations on the over interpretation of statistics in such a small sample size. In particular where you are drawing conclusions using Fisher exact tests on a sample of three patients some groups, this leaves the results open to speculation even if statistically significant. Results:When stating a result is statistically significant it is appropriate just to say that the findings are significant, 'statistically' becomes a redundant word. If something is not statistically significant then it is not significant. So to state 'men use probiotics less commonly than women but this was not statistically significant' is incorrect, statistically there is no difference. This is repeated throughout the paper and should be corrected.What would be really interesting is if there was a control group of patients who did not have IBD to see whether their probiotic consumption was similar to those with IBD and whether the same confounding factors occurred. At least some comment should be made to this. Given that taste preference was one of the main reasons for using probiotics, this factor should be explored in more detail. In particular some examples of costing would be appropriate. How much more expensive are probiotic yoghurts than normal yoghurts? Would patients have taken the probiotics even if they did not have IBD?I would also like to see some data on length of probiotic use. Presumably if it were used for a while with no benefit then patients would stop taking it. The difference between ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s is interesting and I just wonder if this represents differences in quality of life.Was there any perception that probiotics actually reduced or improved patient’s quality of life or reduce the symptoms?Discussion:Given that taste preference was one of the major findings this perhaps should be more dominant in a discussion. I guess it also would be linked to marketing side, which is quite powerful. Overall there is a bit of repetition and the text is a bit verbose, it could be edited down a little. I have read this submission. I believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard, however I have significant reservations, as outlined above.

As a consequence, different strains of a single bacterial species sometimes have the ability to explore distinct niches, to be pathogenic or non-pathogenic and to present different metabolic pathways1,2. In such a scenario, the identification of bacteria isolates to the species level is a hard task1,2.Currently, the genus Streptococcus comprises 99 recognized species, many of which are associated with disease in humans and animals (http://www.bacterio.net/s/streptococcus.html). The viridans group streptococci (VGS) encompass four phylogenetic clusters: Mitis, Mutans, Salivarius and Anginosus, which are part of the human microbiota, being isolated mainly from the oral cavity, gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts3. The Mitis group currently includes the important pathogen S. pneumoniae and 12 other recognized species, S. australis, S. cristatus (formerly S. crista), S. gordonii, S. infantis, S.mitis, S. oligofermentans, S. oralis, S. parasanguinis (formerly S. parasanguis), S. peroris, S. pseudopneumoniae, S. sanguinis (formerly S. sanguis) and S. sinensis. The Anginosus group includes three recognized species, S. anginosus, S. constellatus (including two subspecies S. constellatus subsp. constellatus and S. constellatus pharyngis) and S. intermedius, and the Salivarius group includes S. salivarius, S. vestibularis, and S. thermophilus.Currently, bacterial species are considered to be a group of strains (including the type strain) that are characterized by a certain degree of phenotypic consistency, showing > 70% DNA-DNA hybridization values and over 97% 16S rRNA sequence similarity4,5. Identification of streptococci is based on the current taxonomic standards using a combination of 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses, DNA-DNA hybridization, serologic and phenotypic data; however, they have been strikingly resistant to satisfactory classification, reflected in frequently changing nomenclature6,7. For instance, the 16S rRNA gene sequences of S. mitis and S. oralis are almost identical (> 99%) to S. pneumoniae, making the use of this information alone insufficient to distinguish these species8.Recent studies have used whole genome analysis to determine the taxonomic relationships among bacterial species9–14. In order to determine the robustness of genomic markers in streptococci species delineation, we analyzed a collection of 67 complete genomes. The availability of whole genome sequences of several closely related species, for instance, S. mitis - S. oralis - S. pneumoniae, and S. salivarius - S. thermophilus - S. vestibularis, formed an ideal test case for the establishment of the genomic taxonomy of streptococci.","03 Apr 2013","Approved","Bruno Gomez-Gil, CIAD, A.C., Mazatlán Unit for Aquaculture and Environmental Management, Mexico",NA," The article is well written with an appropriate title and abstract.

The CT runs through the middle ear where is particularly susceptible to injury during ear surgeries1. CT transection (CTx) is accompanied by a disappearance of taste buds on the denervated side of the tongue2,3. At the same time, significant microglial responses also occur in the first central gustatory relay – the nucleus of the solitary tract (nTS)4. This nerve damage can cause a loss or distortion of taste, or dysguesia, that can persist for months or years long after the CT nerve and taste buds have regenerated5. Such long-lasting dysguesias suggest alterations in central nervous function.The central glial reactivity that occurs after damage to other sensory nerves actively contributes to abnormal sensations that arise after nerve damage. For example, increasing evidence from animal models suggests that microglial reactivity in particular is essential to initiate and maintain chronic pain (reviewed in6–9. This in large part explains why traditional pain drugs that directly target neuronal cells do not completely quiet persistent pain messages – because the neurons’ heightened sensitivity is also driven by microglia. A similar phenomenon might explain the lasting dysguesias after injury to the CT. Hence, understanding the mechanisms involved in microglial responses has important implications for treating abnormal sensations caused by nerve injury.Even though the CT nerve does not contain any nociceptive C-fibers10, which are themselves a source of microglial responses11,12, the general profile of the microglial responses are similar with CT injury as that seen in pain models. Specifically, damage to the CT causes significant microglial responses in terms of morphological reactivity and an increased density of microglial cells. Within a day after CT injury, microglia in the vicinity of afferent CT terminals changed their morphology from the characteristic ramified morphology to a hypertrophied reactive morphology, characterized by shorter thicker processes and an amoeboid shape. The increased microglial population primarily resulted from microglial proliferation, which was supplemented by microglial migration within sub-divisions of the nTS4.While the details of how nerve injury activates microglia are not entirely known, in nerve injuries that result in neuropathic pain pharmaceutical treatments can diminish pain behavior as well as the corresponding microglial responses. Therefore, various treatments and models that decrease microglial responses in experimental pain models were used here to test if they could dampen the microglial responses in the nTS after CT injury.Purinergic signaling (P2X2 and P2X3)Microglia express multiple purinergic receptors. Upon sensing changes in the environment, this purinergic signaling results in several functional phenotypes such as process extension, migration, proliferation and phagocytosis (reviewed in13). Here, we used mice that lack the P2X2 and P2X3 receptors to test whether these subunits are required for microglial responses following CT injury. Further, because the gustatory nerves of the P2X-dlbKO mice are not responsive to taste stimulation14, this model also tested whether the disruption of normal gustatory signaling might alter microglial reactivity.MinocyclineThis antibiotic is commonly used to treat chronic pain in animal models. Minocycline is a tetracycline derivative with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects that are unrelated to its anti-microbial action (see reviews15,16). This compound is highly hydrophobic and readily crosses the blood-brain barrier. Multiple effects can account for the alleviation of pain behavior with minocycline, such as inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase as well as other anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-apoptotic properties17–19. Minocycline treatment also results in reduced expression of the microglial marker Iba120. Although this treatment has many modes of action, minocycline can only prevent but not reverse neuropathic pain21. Therefore, to test if minocycline could diminish microglial reactivity in the nTS, the minocycline was administered to the animals before they received CTx and the animals continued to receive treatment for the duration of their survival.Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)Recent studies have shown that TLR4 signaling is involved in nerve injury-induced microglial reactivity and related pain behavior22,23. Deletion of TLR4 can prevent pain and microglial reactivity from developing after spinal nerve injury22. Hence, we tested whether TLR4 signaling is necessary for microglial reactivity after CT damage by performing CTx on the C3H mice that lack functional TLR4.TLR4 signaling can also be inhibited with naloxone. Recent studies demonstrated that both the opioid antagonist (-)-naloxone and the non-opioid (+)-naloxone inhibit toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling and reverse neuropathic pain following spinal nerve injuries23,24. Hence, we performed CTx on the C57BL6/J animals that were then treated with naloxone as has been done in neuropathic pain models24.The current study used these methods and models and examined their effects on microglial reactivity in the nTS following CT injury. Specifically, we examined microglial morphology, counted the number of microglia and measured the fluorescent intensity of microglial markers.","23 Apr 2013","Approved","Susan Travers, College of Dentistry, Section of Oral Biology, The Ohio State University, USA",NA," This paper is an interesting follow-up to the first author’s recent report (JCN, 2012) that chorda tympani (CT) nerve section causes a robust increase in the number and functional activation of microglia in the rostral nucleus of the solitary tract (rNST), an increase largely confined to the terminal field of that nerve. In the initial paper, the authors established that the mechanism of microglial responses in rNST was distinct from the better-studied response in nociceptive regions of the CNS because of the lack of immune cell migration from bone marrow. The current study provides additional data suggesting that the microglial response in the NST is distinct—it is attenuated only marginally following minocycline treatment and does not rely on the toll-like 4 receptor, again in contrast to what occurs after injury of nociceptive afferents. It is also noteworthy that the microglial response persists in P2X2/P2X3 double knockout mice, suggesting that a lack of gustatory-driven activity does not drive the effect.  The methods, including the analytical approach, were thoroughly explained or suitable references provided. The experimental design was appropriate and the methods used seemed adequate to test the hypotheses advanced. Because the outcomes were essentially negative, however, it would have been more compelling if an example of a positive control had been presented to show that these authors could replicate the attenuation of the microglial response in the pain system, the system from which these techniques were adapted. On the other hand, the fact that 2 different approaches were used to probe the role of TLR-4 is reassuring. The authors’ conclusions are based on the data, which are quite clear, presented in detail, and discussed in an appropriate and scholarly fashion.

The V. cholerae genome consists of two chromosomes. The largest chromosome of 2.96 Mbp encodes most essential genes. The 1.07 Mbp small chromosome contains few essential genes and the superintegron (SI), a large gene capture and excision system of ~120 kbp2 (Figure 1). The SI is characterized by a site-specific integrase gene (IntI4) closely associated with a cognate recombination site attI and a promoter Pc followed by a large array of gene cassettes. Within the SI, the gene cassettes generally consist of a promoterless open reading frame (ORF) flanked by two recombination sites termed V. cholerae repeats (VCRs)3. Cassettes can be excised from any position in the array through VCR × VCR recombination mediated by the integrase. The resulting circular intermediate can then be integrated, preferentially through attI × VCR recombination by the integrase, bringing the cassette under control of Pc4,5. Since gene cassettes are usually promoterless, only the first few cassettes are expressed by Pc and the rest of the array can be seen as a reservoir of standing genetic variation5.Figure 1. Schematic organization of the Vibrio cholerae genome and the superintegron (SI).The functional platform of the SI consists of an integrase gene, a cassette promoter (Pc), and a primary recombination site (attI). The system maintains an array of several cassettes, which generally consist of a promoterless ORF flanked by two recombination sites termed VCR (V. cholerae repeats).The functions of the majority of the SI genes are unknown; however, a few genes have been characterized and it has been suggested that they are involved in adaptive functions such as toxin-antitoxin (TA) loci. TA loci consist of two genes in an operon encoding a ‘toxin’ and an ‘antitoxin’. The expression of the toxins reduces cell growth and prevents colony formation, thus exerting a bacteriostatic rather than bacteriocidal condition. However, cell viability can be rescued by later overproduction of the cognate antitoxins6.The pangenome describes the complete repertoire of genes in a bacterial species, which includes the ""core genome"" containing genes present in all strains, a ""dispensable genome"" containing genes present in two or more strains, and ""unique genes"" specific to single strains7. Previous phylogeographic analysis, considering V. cholerae strains and its sister species Vibrio metecus8, showed that, in contrast to the core genome, the SI displays strong geographical differentiation, and cassettes from the V. cholerae group cluster with those of V. metecus from the same place rather than with cassettes from geographically distinct V. cholerae. It suggested that SI structure is influenced by geographic boundaries and in response to environmental conditions. The flexible nature of the SI that results from gene cassette capture, deletion and rearrangement is thought to make it a hotspot of V. cholerae diversity, but beyond the basic structure it is not clear if there is a core genome in the SI and if so how it is structured. The aim of this work was to explore the core genome structure and the differential gene content among strains of V. cholerae.","14 Apr 2014","Approved","Nur Hasan, Maryland Pathogen Research Institute, University of Maryland, USA",NA," In this manuscript Marin and Vicente investigated the genomic diversity of V. cholerae Super Integron (SI) with the aim to identify a set of orthologous genes that are conserved and unique among and in between V. cholerae and V. mimicus SI’s. While one must appreciate the efforts that have gone into the analyses, unfortunately, given the known diversity of V. cholerae SI, the number of genomes analyzed was very limited, and was not a good representative of all major phyletic lineages of V. cholerae either. Yet, the manuscript provides some valuable information about the diversity and repository of SI genes and their biological functions. The core genes estimates for SI (21 and 8, among V. cholerae and V. cholerae-V. mimicus respectively) reported in this study may not be very meaningful as the core genome might diminish or at least reduced further if additional genomes from distinct lineages are included. I strongly recommend inclusion of additional genomes at least from the major phylogenetic lineages of V. cholerae O1. The function of TA loci as an essential stress response element needs to be supported by some experimental data.

It has become apparent that some of the processing intermediates may have biological activities of their own. Significant biological effects have been reported for both the larger progastrin precursor peptide and the shorter carboxyl-terminal glycine-extended gastrin (G-Gly), suggesting that these are important pathophysiological mediators. The majority of studies have examined the pathophysiological roles of gastrin precursors in gastrointestinal cancers and considerable data have implicated these peptides as stimulants of proliferation and/or inhibitors of apoptosis in a variety of tissues and cell lines, including Barrett’s oeosphagus and oesophageal adenocarcinoma2,3, stomach4,5, pancreas6,7 and normal and malignant colonic epithelium8–12. Growth promoting effects of G-Gly on lung cancer have also been reported13.Although the precise cell signaling pathways activated by gastrin-processing intermediates have not been definitively described, it seems in most cases that mechanisms distinct from the classical gastrin (CCK2) receptor are involved3,6,10. It is not yet clear whether these gastrin-processing intermediates have distinct physiological, as opposed to pathophysiological roles. Glycine-extended gastrin is produced and stored in significant amounts in the gastric antrum, has gastrointestinal trophic effects and interacts with amidated gastrin to modulate gene expression and gastric acid secretion14–16. Gastrin stimulates both acid secretion and somatostatin release as a feedback inhibitory mechanism17. Similarly, release of cholecystokinin (CCK) from duodenal I-cells is believed to be an important negative feedback mechanism, leading to the inhibition of acid secretion via the release of somatostatin from D-cells in the gastric body and fundus17. Somatostatin release is also stimulated by several other peptide hormones released from the proximal and distal small bowel (including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), secretin and oxyntomodulin18 and these form part of the physiological feedback mechanisms that decrease gastric acid in the post-prandial period.

Gastrin (but not G-Gly) had an acute effect following 2h treatment, but both peptides appeared in some way to prime the cells after 20h incubation, so that basal and agonist-stimulated somatostatin release were increased. The concentrations of gastrin peptides used in these experiments were high (10nM) and it would therefore be interesting to investigate whether lower concentrations of Gastrin and G-Gly also exerted similar effects in this experimental system. It would be worth referencing the paper which confirmed high homology between the amino acid sequences of human and rabbit gastrin-17, as human peptides were used in this study. It would also be interesting to investigate whether other gastrin precursors (eg progastrin) caused similar effects. I have read this submission.

Arabidopsis WRKY17, together with another family member WRKY11, is a negative regulator of the basal defense response2. The WRKY17 and WRKY11 genes are usually induced during the defense response, and Arabidopsis loss-of-function mutants wrky17 and wrky11 display higher expression of numerous stress- or defense-related genes and show increased resistance to infection by Pseudomonas, but not by other pathogens. Thus, WRKY17 and WRKY11 have been suggested to play a role in the fine-tuning of the defense response, avoiding the effect of excessive reaction2.Among the target genes of WRKY17/WRKY11 is VIP1, which is overexpressed in both wrky11 and wrky17 mutants2. VIP1 is a multifunctional bZIP transcription factor that stimulates stress- and defense-related gene expression by binding to a specific DNA hexamer motif present in many promoters that respond to activation of the MPK3 pathway3, including the PR1 pathogenesis-related gene4. VIP1 might also be involved in other stress-dependent regulation pathways, such as osmosensory signaling5. Interestingly, the VIP1-related defense responses are activated during Agrobacterium-host plant interactions, and Agrobacterium has evolved to subvert them to facilitate the infection process4,6.VIP1, a host protein initially discovered as an interacting partner of the Agrobacterium T-DNA packaging protein VirE27, is involved in several critical aspects of plant genetic transformation by Agrobacterium. Specifically, VIP1 is thought to facilitate nuclear import of the T-DNA-protein complexes7–9, their targeting to the host chromatin10–12, and proteasomal uncoating of the T-DNA molecule from its associated proteins prior to integration13–15. Thus, we investigated one of the VIP1-controlling WRKY mutants, wrky17, in regard to VIP1 expression and the potential effects on Agrobacterium infection.","30 Aug 2013","Approved","Herman Scholthof, Department of Plant Pathology and Microbiology, Bioenvironmental Sciences, The College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Texas A&M University, USA",NA," I approve the corrections.

UVC radiation is filtered by the atmosphere and technically does not exist on the earth’s surface. However, a fraction of UVB and much of the UVA wavelength radiation reach the surface of the earth and have been implicated in skin cancers and other acute and chronic aberrations of the skin such as sunburn and premature skin aging, respectively. Most of the skin cancer-causing effects of sunlight have been ascribed to UVB radiation with a smaller contribution from UVA1,2. UVB induces direct DNA damage through the formation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and another dipyrimidine lesion, the (6-4) photoproduct3–6. Of these two types of lesions, the CPD is thought to be responsible for the majority of mutations induced by UVB or sunlight irradiation7,8. These mutations are characterized by a preponderance of C to T transition mutations at dipyrimidine sites containing cytosine, for example 5'TC and 5'CC. Very often, 5-methylcytosines (mC), when part of a dipyrimidine sequence, are seen as preferential sites of CPD formation and also as preferential mutational target sites in mammalian cells9–11. These types of mutations, i.e. C or mC to T mutations at 5'TC, 5'CC, 5'TmC, and 5'CmC, are recognized as the major mutational events in human skin cancers, both in specific genes4 and in large-scale genomic sequencing studies analyzing thousands of different genes simultaneously12–14.Besides mutations, the other frequent change observed at the DNA level of skin cancer genomes is the aberration of DNA cytosine methylation patterns. Like most cancer types, both nonmelanoma and melanoma skin cancers are characterized by substantially aberrant DNA methylation15–21. DNA hypermethylation is widespread and affects many CpG islands, which are defined as CpG dinucleotide-rich genomic sequences, often found around promoters of genes. This DNA hypermethylation can affect hundreds of genes in individual tumors, sometimes producing a cancer-driving event, for example if genes involved in growth control and/or DNA repair are involved22,23. Although the methylation changes were first described many years ago, the mechanisms of cancer-associated DNA hypermethylation or hypomethylation have remained obscure. One model proposes that environmental influences, in the form of exposure of humans to either chemicals or radiation, may produce these aberrant DNA methylation events24. For example, one could conceive a scenario in which this exposure induces a signaling cascade and transcriptional changes inside cells that would affect DNA methylation patterns, for example by modulating the DNA methylation machinery or the chromatin state at genes that become susceptible to methylation. Such UV-induced heritable DNA methylation changes could lead to an altered phenotype and could provide a selective advantage to cells, perhaps when combined with UVB-induced mutations, and could thus be viewed as a tumor-driving event. In this study, we examined this hypothesis by exposing human keratinocytes chronically to UVB radiation and by assessing DNA methylation patterns on a genomic scale following UV exposure of cells and a recovery period.","18 Mar 2013","Approved","Shisheng Li, Louisiana State University, USA",NA," This is a scientifically sound and clearly written article.

The authors made appropriate speculations about the causes and timing for DNA methylation changes observed in human skin cancers. In view of the nature of somatic cancer development, namely stochastic transformation followed by clonal selection, it is also possible that UVB exposures cause DNA methylation change in only a small fraction of the cells, which cannot be detected with techniques that can only measure collective overall changes but not those in individual cells.

Prey heterogeneity can mediate trophic-level responses to enrichment and weaken top-down limitation of prey communities by facilitating numerical dominance by defended prey2,4,7,10–12. Such shifts in dominance can have significant dynamic consequences, potentially reducing the propensity and severity of predator-prey oscillations and stabilizing community dynamics1,3,5,9. While empirical research has largely focused on the consequences of interspecific variation in prey edibility, a growing body of experiments has begun to highlight the dynamic consequences of intraspecific trait variation. When prey populations exhibit phenotypic variation in their susceptibility to predators and show rapid adaptive responses to predation pressure, they can fundamentally alter the strength and dynamic consequences of their interactions with their consumers13–18.The effects of prey heterogeneity on predator-prey dynamics has been extensively explored in the context of endogenously driven population cycles. Cycles are a common feature of simple, two-species predator-prey models that incorporate nonlinear functional responses19–22. Such oscillatory dynamics become more probable and increase in amplitude with increasing prey carrying capacity20,21. Inclusion of prey heterogeneity in the form of species that are defended from predation can in theory stabilize predator-prey cycles. This readily occurs when prey species trade off their ability to compete for shared resources with their capacity to resist predation. In such instances, predators can facilitate the invasion and persistence of defended prey which, in turn, siphon resources from more edible species, reducing their carrying capacity. This can, in some cases, decrease the amplitude of predator-edible prey cycles or move systems from periodic to point attractors3,5,23. Predator-mediated increases in the relative abundance of defended prey may also weaken top-down limitation of trophic-level abundance causing an increase in total prey abundance relative to prey community’s lacking trait heterogeneity2,4,7,10–12.While the abovementioned models were developed with the intent of understanding the dynamic consequences of heterogeneity among prey species, their general predictions may, under certain conditions, apply to heterogeneity that occurs within species. For instance, models of trophic structure that incorporate prey evolutionary dynamics show that heritable variation in defense against predators may allow prey populations to adaptively respond to predation pressure, shifting regulation of prey populations from top-down control to stronger bottom-up control13,24. Several models have also explored how adaptive responses in prey defense may impact predator-prey dynamics and stability14–16,18,24–26. These demonstrate the capacity for prey evolution to dramatically alter predator-prey dynamics but stabilization is not a generalizable prediction. While adaptive responses in prey defense may stabilize predator or prey populations under certain conditions14,15,24, evolution can also give rise to destabilization of predator-prey cycles and enhanced extinction probability14,16,17,25,26.Only a handful of studies have attempted to address the dynamic consequences of intraspecific variability in prey edibility using direct manipulations in which prey evolution was either suppressed xor promoted16,17,27. Moreover, previous experiments have only considered phenotypes or species with fixed traits. For many organisms, ecological strategies may involve transitions between dynamic classes that vary in their susceptibility to predators, with variation among phenotypes consisting of variation in state transition rates or degree of invulnerability. This could apply to organisms that change behavioral/physiological states or who move in and out of spatial refuges. It could also occur with colony-forming organisms in which colonies of increasing size are more resistant to predators. Prior work has shown that such prey strategies can stabilize predator-prey cycles1. However, this has not been examined within an evolutionary context.We tested this experimentally using a laboratory-based aquatic system composed of the zooplankton-predator Brachionus calyciflorus and the algal-prey Synura petersenii, in which the potential for prey evolution was either enhanced or reduced through direct manipulations of initial prey genetic diversity. Our study differed from prior work in its use of an algal-prey species that can transition between a vulnerable and predator-resistant class. Synura petersenii is a common freshwater flagellate that may transition between two states: either free-living cells (which are more susceptible to zooplankton predators) or as swimming colonies (which are less susceptible to zooplankton feeding due to their larger size). Reproduction can occur in either the free-living state or in the colony state through binary fission. The strains of S. petersenii used in our study exhibit heritable variation in their propensity to form colonies and their degree of vulnerability when in the colony state due to variation in colony size (Figure 1). Cellular aggregation and colony formation are viewed as key steps in the evolution of multicellularity28–30. Thus, our work also permits exploration of the selective forces that may favor colonial strategies. We show that the initial presence of trait heterogeneity among prey can reduce top-down limitation of prey and alter predator-prey dynamics by reducing temporal variation in total prey abundance. This stabilization is associated with an increase in the size of colonies and the relative abundance of cells found in colonies.Figure 1.

This last finding is by far the strongest and I think that it adds substantially to a current important topic. A second relevant finding is that, despite having only a single strain with low variability, the high genetic variability replicates had also more stable dynamics than the one single strain.The finding that colony formation was linked to predator presence and that there was a trend in which colony formation increased through time also provides a hint on how multicellularity evolved.However, unfortunately I do not think that this article provides convincing evidence of an evolutionary response of defense through colony formation as the authors claim. First, in their preliminary assays the authors did not combine the different strains to see how they form colonies when different strains are present in the same habitat. We do not know if they are able to combine and to cooperate with other strains (at least with the information provided) and if there are emergent patterns of colony formation when more than one strain is combined.The findings that defense (aggregative behaviour) increase when predators are present could be just the result of complex patterns of (plastic) cooperation among strains which change through time, for instance as a response to persistent predation risk. Assays at the end of the experiment to test if after removing predators, colonies were still maintained at substantially high rates (e.g. as in strain LB2405) would have been a convincing evidence for adaptive evolution ocurring during the dynamics.

They allowed activity comparison within and between different organisations as well as providing a means of making longitudinal analyses of trends in treatment and service provision. Local adaptations or variants of diagnosis related groups (DRGs) have been adopted as the unit of payments to hospitals in many health systems1. This is a system that classifies hospital cases into identifiable groups in order to identify ‘products’ that a hospital provides. The system was originally developed in the USA in order to replace ‘cost-based’ reimbursement. DRGs are based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) and the presence of complications or co-morbidity. This model of classification has spread to other countries including Australia, Denmark, France, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and Russia; followed by a less rapid spread from acute care into long-term care and psychiatry2.In England, the NHS Plan of July 2000 introduced the government’s intention to link the allocation of hospital funds to the activity they undertake – a system of payment by results (PbR)3. PbR underpinned the NHS reform agenda and was formally implemented by The Department of Health in 2002 as a mechanism to reimburse hospitals in England for levels of activity undertaken. Under this new system of PbR hospitals were reimbursed for activities undertaken using a fixed price tariff that reflected national average prices for hospital procedures4. Such prices are standardised across the NHS with adjustments for higher labour costs in London. The main aim of PbR was to improve efficiency and increase value for money in the NHS by enhancing service quality, facilitating patient choice, enabling service innovation, improving quality of service and reducing waiting times by rewarding healthcare providers for the volumes of work completed.PbR has continued to be implemented in the NHS (albeit incrementally) both in terms of scope and financial impact. The first NHS foundation trust (FT) applicants moved to the full PbR system in 2005–06 and other NHS trusts in 2006–074. In 2006–2007 PbR was extended to include non-elective, outpatient and emergency admissions for all trusts5. In 2009–2010, the national tariff for admitted patient care and outpatient activity was for the first time defined in terms of Healthcare Resource Groups (HRGs), an English variant of DRGs. The Department of Health in the UK defines HRGs as groupings of treatment episodes that are similar in resource use and clinical response. They are a standard method of analysing clinical procedures and thereby classification of hospital activity6 HRGs are reviewed every four years to ensure they accurately reflect clinical practice.Although the imposition of payment by results was intended as a fair and consistent basis for hospital funding it also rewards hospitals by volume of work completed. Its overarching aim was to allow the commissioning of activity volumes that were required to deliver service priorities from a plurality of providers on the basis of a standard, national pricing tariff. By standardising prices, it was intended to promote non-price competition, i.e. provider differentiation on the basis of service quality4.NHS commissioners therefore faced a very challenging agenda. They needed to secure high quality services which remained safe for patients, whilst at the same time trying to achieve best value for the budgets available.","28 Feb 2013","Approved","Lynda Bonner, King's Thrombosis Centre, Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UK",NA," This is an interesting mixed methods study. It provides a comprehensive background to incentive payments (payment by volume and payment by results) in the NHS. The authors mention that compliance with VTE CQUIN targets 2010-11 was measured through a monthly audit of patients who received appropriate thrombo-prophylaxis after risk assessment, however, it is worth adding that the financial incentive for reaching a 90% threshold for VTE risk assessment was based on census data collection and that Unify2 contains data on the VTE risk assessment indicator only. The section on motivation in the NHS is particularly relevant to those who are in a position to use CQUIN as a driver to lead the implementation of effective VTE prevention practice in their organisation. The power of CQUIN relies on its meaningful translation of its implications for staff within the healthcare organisation. The authors give examples of how CQUIN can act as a motivator to engage different staff groups that have a role in VTE prevention and suggest that there was less evidence of improvement where unachievable clauses for achieving CQUIN rewards existed. This highlights the importance of commissioners and providers agreeing realistic targets to activate the motivational potential of CQUIN. The study methodology appears justified and sound. Any limitations in methodology were acknowledged and where possible action was taken to minimise their potential impact. Ethical issues were considered and authorisation for the study was granted by the appropriate authorities. Findings are discussed within the wider context of practice nationally and debate created around the intrinsic/extrinsic motivations that may have been triggered by payment by results. It might be worth reflecting on the authors positive view of CQUIN as a financial 'carrot' and whether this may have influenced their interpretation of findings related to motivation. (This is in contrast to the more negative view held by some that CQUIN is a financial 'stick' whereby monies allocated for an organisation will be withheld if they are unable to meet their targets). The snowball sampling technique could have limited the richness of data that might have been gathered from untapped sources. This study adds to the current knowledge base and its findings support a positive correlation between a statistically significant improvement in the percentage of patients risk assessed for VTE and the achievement of CQUIN payments amongst the study sample. It also offers an insight into the perceptions of CQUIN as a motivator and acknowledges that further research in the area is needed. It should be of genuine interest to those in the field of VTE prevention or to those who are aiming to achieve CQUIN payments for their organisation. I have read this submission.

Cocaine and other tropane alkaloids such as atropine and scopolamine act on the nervous system, and their activity is largely due to their common chemical backbone (the tropane nucleus)1. Despite the socioeconomic importance of cocaine and other tropane alkaloids, the molecular basis for the biosynthesis of the tropane nucleus remains unknown. E. coca is emerging as a model for the investigation of tropane alkaloid synthesis2–4, and shows high-level, localized tropane alkaloid production and storage in its leaf tissue3,4.We have performed metabolic and enzymatic studies to identify the molecular and biochemical basis of tropane alkaloid biosynthesis in E. coca, and have developed a number of genomic tools such as expressed sequence tag (EST) libraries and 454 sequence databases2–4. Quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) would be a further source of information on candidate tropane alkaloid biosynthesis genes in the different tissues of the coca plant.qRT-PCR is widely used to quantify and compare levels of gene transcription5. Variables such as RNA quality and the efficiencies of reverse transcription and PCR may compromise the accuracy and reliability of qRT-PCR, and so results are typically ‘normalized’ by comparison with one or more internal reference genes6. The internal reference genes must be stably expressed, and the most stable reference genes vary widely in different species, tissues and sets of experimental conditions. Therefore, the identification of stable reference genes is a crucial step in the design of qRT-PCR experiments.Traditionally, ‘Housekeeping’ genes such as actin, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and ubiquitin were used for data normalization7,8. These genes were widely assumed to have a uniform level of expression due to their involvement in fundamental cellular processes. However, evaluation of the expression stability of classical housekeeping genes in many species including Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, Zea mays and Linum usitatissimus9–12 has revealed unstable expression of these genes under a range of experimental conditions. In addition, several novel reference genes have been shown to be more stably expressed than classical housekeeping genes13. Hence there is a need for systematic validation of internal reference genes in each organism and experiment9,14.The stability of candidate internal reference genes may be assessed using a number of models, including geNorm15, NormFinder16 and BestKeeper17. These models differ significantly in their assumptions, and so candidate genes are often assessed with several of these algorithms18. geNorm iteratively calculates an expression stability value (M) for each candidate gene. This is based on the mean pairwise variation between the gene and the other candidate genes across all samples. Genes with lower M values are more stably expressed, and less stable genes (with higher M) are progressively excluded from the analysis. The optimal number of reference genes for qRT-PCR normalization may also be determined by identifying the smallest number of genes needed to minimize mean variation. By contrast, NormFinder estimates the standard deviation for each gene relative to the global expression of all genes included in the analysis, and genes with lower standard deviations are considered better reference genes. BestKeeper uses a third approach involving the calculation of a stability index (the ‘BestKeeper index’ or BKI), which is assumed to represent the highest level of stability because it includes all genes across all samples. The stability of each reference gene is assessed by its correlation with the BKI, with a high correlation indicating a more stable reference gene15–17.In this study, we evaluate the stability of nine candidate reference genes (Ec6409, Ec10131, Ec11142, Actin, APT2, EF1a, TPB1, Pex4 and Pp2aa3) in a variety of E. coca tissues (four developmental leaf stages, stems, roots and flowers). We then identify the most stable internal reference genes using the geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper algorithms and present guidelines for transcript analysis in different tissues of E. coca by qRT-PCR.","15 Feb 2013","Approved","Sarah O'Connor, Biological Chemistry Department, John Innes Centre, UK",NA," I have read this submission.

They are ancient, structurally diverse elements of the immune responses of all living species. These molecules typically have broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity with conserved recognition patterns to molecules such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and lipoteichoic acid. They are rapidly induced on the order of minutes to hours. Their amphipathic structures facilitate their antimicrobial killing activity at the level of the bacterial membrane. It has become increasingly apparent that CAPs also play key roles in inflammatory responses and in orchestrating the mechanisms of innate immunity1.LL-37, or human cathelicidin, is a CAP that has been localized to airway epithelium. In its mature form, it is an a-helical peptide made up of 37 residues that has been shown to possess broad spectrum antibacterial activity as well as other host defense functions such as chemotaxis, LPS neutralization, angiogenesis, and wound healing. First cloned from a bone marrow library, the expression of this peptide has been detected in many epithelial tissues, including the testes, epidermis, and the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts2. The antibacterial and immunomodulatory roles of the cathelicidins are currently under intense investigation and appropriate models of infection are required for understanding their contribution to host defense.LL-37 is also an important modulator of the human immune response. This host-derived CAP is an antiseptic agent with the ability to inhibit macrophage stimulation by bacterial components such as LPS, lipoteichoic acid, and noncapped lipoarabinomannan3. Using gene expression profiling to identify potential LL-37-modulated macrophage functions, LL-37 directly upregulated 29 genes and downregulated another 20 genes. Among the genes predicted to be upregulated by LL-37 were those encoding chemokines and chemokine receptors. Consistent with this, LL-37 upregulated the expression of chemokines in macrophages and the mouse lung (monocyte chemoattractant protein 1), human A549 epithelial cells (IL-8), and whole human blood (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and IL-8), without stimulating the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-a. LL-37 also upregulated the chemokine receptors CXCR-4, CCR2, and IL-8RB. It appears that LL-37 contributes to the immune response by limiting the damage caused by bacterial products and recruiting immune cells to the site of infection4.WLBU-2, by comparison, is a completely synthetic a-helical, engineered CAP (eCAP) made up of a repeating sequence of Arg, Lys, and Trp residues5–7. Previous work has demonstrated this compound’s broad spectrum antibacterial activity against bacterial pathogens in both in vivo and in vitro systems5,6,8. Among the many antimicrobial peptides currently described in the literature, eCAPs are most chemically and structurally homologous to the magainins9 and LL-37. They are peptides of approximately 30 residues that, when modeled as an a-helix, demonstrate amphipathic character with defined cationic and hydrophobic faces. The selectivity of the eCAPs for bacterial membranes, like other host-derived CAPs, presumably results from their affinity for negatively charged lipids found on the bacterial surface. The high-energy potential of the bacterial membrane facilitates self-promoted CAP uptake, thus compromising the integrity of the bacterial cell by disrupting the lipid bilayer10 and suggests that these a-helical peptides11 may be suitable agents for treating bacterial airway infections.Despite extensive characterization of the antimicrobial activity of the eCAPs, little is known about their immunomodulatory properties5,6. The purpose of this study was to determine if WLBU-2 modulates an early proinflammatory response to facilitate Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) clearance using both in vivo and in vitro models. The in vivo model partially replicates some of the phenotypic lung disease of CF in mice that resemble wild-type animals in size and survival. Development of a murine model of lung inflammation is highly desirable to accelerate pre-clinical testing of novel anti-inflammatory therapeutics. These studies demonstrate the immunomodulatory properties of an engineered, synthetic compound not only for the purpose of its potential development as a novel antibacterial agent, but also for its contribution to study the role of a-helical peptides in the processes of host defense.","25 Oct 2013","Approved","Paul Savage, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Brigham Young University, USA",NA," This manuscript makes a correlation between the antibacterial and immunomodulatory effects of LL-37 and the synthetic antimicrobial peptide WLBU-2. The authors find that WLBU-2 stimulates cytokine (IL-8) production, which is likely to impact bacterial clearance. This observation implies that the WLBU-2 is interacting comparably with receptors that respond to the presence of LL-37. Overall, the manuscript is well written, the data are well presented, and though the body of work is modest, it should be of interest to a relatively large group of researchers.

In this setting, optimal post-operative pain relief is the goal. This not only improves patient comfort and allows expedient discharge from hospital, but also reduces the risk of developing post-operative chronic pain and may improve surgical outcome1–4.Optimal post-operative pain control in day-case surgery remains a challenge5. There is considerable variation in the level of post-operative pain experienced between individuals and subsequent analgesia requirements. Previous studies have attempted to predict the level of acute post-operative pain an individual will experience, using a variety of complex pre-operative pain and psychological assessments6,7. Other investigators have focussed on a simpler approach, by testing an individual’s pain threshold to a single pre-operative nociceptive stimulus, e.g. heat or pressure8–11. An increase in pain sensitivity in these pre-operative experimental tests appears to correlate with a higher level of post-operative pain and an increased risk of developing persistent post-operative pain12. Electrocutaneous stimulation has also been shown to be a reliable and safe method for assessment of pain and sensory thresholds6,13–18. The technique has previously been used as a predictive tool in the Obstetric surgery setting using the Pain Matcher® (Cefar Medical AB, Lund, Sweden)19.The Pain Matcher is a small hand held device that has been validated against the visual analogue scale (VAS) for reliable pain assessment in patients with a range of acute and chronic pain, as well as for pre-operative pain threshold assessment19–24. When the contact pads on the Pain Matcher are gripped between the thumb and forefinger, the device delivers a small, micro-processor controlled, non-harmful electric current to the individual. Variations between individuals’ skin resistance are compensated for. The electrical current consists of rectangular pulses at 10 Hz with 10mA amplitude, which is gradually increased by 4 µs rises in pulse width, from zero to a maximum of 396 µs. This occurs over a total of 99 steps and ceases when the individual releases their grip on the device. The results are displayed on an LCD screen, on a scale from 1 to 99, which is directly related to the pulse width. Higher Pain Matcher values indicate a higher pain threshold17,18,21.We aimed to assess the predictive value of pre-operative pain threshold measurements, made via electrocutaneous stimulation, for the intensity of post-operative pain experienced following arthroscopic subacromial decompression surgery.","19 Jun 2013","Approved with Reservations","Irene Lund, Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Karolinska Institute, Sweden",NA," In order to contribute to a better control of postoperative pain, this is a very interesting, well described and important clinical study. There are, however, some issues to discuss:Explanation to why there were incomplete data for 9 patients.Description on how the postoperative pain assessments using VAS were performed.The rationale for using both parametric and non-parametric tests. In the manuscript the pain data (by the use of VAS and Pain Matcher) are shown as median and range, referring to that the dataset has ordinal properties, which are adequate for subjectively based assessments such as pain thresholds where the assumption of the distribution of the data is not necessary. In this case, the non-parametric analysis will give more meaning to the analysis than the use of parametric analysis that is based on data that have linear properties and that require knowledge of the data material distribution.The results are presented separate for women and men in table 1 and 2 which is very interesting since obvious gender differences are reported in threshold assessments. It would have been interesting to see separate results based on gender in table 3.The reported values of pain thresholds represent a wide range from 4-99 in men and 4-37 in women. In other studies using the Pain Matcher, the lowest level of your reported pain threshold is reported in the range of the sensory threshold assessed by Pain Matcher. Could the finding be due to the instruction given to the patients on what they were supposed to feel when reaching the pain threshold? In other words, could the sensation of unpleasantness, present before reaching the pain threshold, be a part of the results and thereby explain some of the great dispersion in the data?  I have read this submission. I believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard, however I have significant reservations, as outlined above.

IntroductionIn kinetoplastid protists, several metabolic pathways, including glycolysis, purine salvage and ether lipid biosynthesis, are located in a microbody, the glycosome1,2, which is evolutionarily related to peroxisomes. All evidence so far indicates that the glycosomal membrane, like the peroxisomal membrane, is impermeable to nucleotides, notably adenosine phosphates and NAD(P)(H)3,4. Its permeability to smaller molecules, however, is subject to debate5. Specific transporters would be required if the membrane were impermeable to molecules of the size of glycolytic intermediates, such as glucose, phosphate, malate, pyruvate, phosphoenolpyruvate and various triosephosphates.In 1987, the first protein profile of glycosomal membranes from Trypanosoma brucei was published6. It revealed two abundant proteins of 24 and 26 kDa, which were later shown to be trypanosome homologues of the peroxisome biogenesis protein PEX117–9. Subsequent studies, including two of the glycosomal proteome1,10, revealed several more trypanosome PEX proteins that are predicted to be membrane-bound, such as PEX211,12, PEX1013, PEX1213, PEX1314 and PEX1415. The only transporters known to be associated with the glycosomal membrane are the ABC transporters GAT1, GAT2 and GAT3, which might transport fatty acids16. In addition, a member of the mitochondrial carrier protein family was found: MCP6, which is a candidate for nucleotide transport17. MCP6 is found preferentially in the glycosomal membranes of bloodstream-form trypanosomes, whereas in procyclic forms, it is predominantly targeted to the mitochondria17.No analysis has yet yielded evidence for glycosomal transporters of metabolites smaller than about 400 Da. In contrast, lipid bilayers that were reconstituted with glycosomal membrane proteins revealed evidence for the presence of anion- and cation-selective pores5. The identities of these pore-forming proteins are still unknown: they could be dedicated exclusively to metabolite transport, or they might be involved in protein import as well5.If proteins other than PEX components were indeed involved in metabolite transport, it ought to be possible to find them by mass spectrometry, using highly purified glycosomal membrane protein preparations. A similar proteomics approach has been previously used for mammalian peroxisomes. Analysis of carbonate-washed rat liver peroxisomes initially yielded only two peroxisomal membrane proteins, PMP70 and PMP2218, whereas a later analysis of whole mouse kidney peroxisomes led to the identification of 12 putative glycosomal membrane proteins. These included one tetratricopeptide domain protein, four different ABC transporters, three members of the PMP22 family, PMP34, Pxmp4/PMP4, and the putative solute carrier PMP4719.Specific transporters for glycolytic metabolites might have been missed in previous glycosomal proteomic analyses, since glycosomal membrane proteins are likely to comprise a rather small proportion of the total protein content. We have therefore set out to identify the proteins in a highly enriched glycosomal membrane preparation from Leishmania tarentolae, using 30-times more starting material than used for our previously published T. brucei glycosomal proteome study1. Comprehensive mass spectrometry analysis of these highly purified glycosomal membrane protein fractions did not, however, lead to the identification of any novel glycosomal transporters. We therefore postulate that the recently described porin activity5 in the glycosomal membrane might be provided by known components of the glycosomal protein import machinery (peroxins), as has also been suggested for peroxisomes20. In addition, we compared the phospholipid compositions of the glycosomal membranes from bloodstream- and procyclic-form T. brucei, with the lipid composition of the T. brucei cell membrane to see if this could give us more information regarding glycosomal membrane transport.","27 Mar 2013","Approved","Peter J. Myler, Seattle Biomedical Research Institute, USA",NA," In this manuscript, Colasante et al. describe an exhaustive analysis of the membrane proteins and lipids present in glycosomes from the kinetoplastid protozoan parasite, Leishmania tarentolae, and conclude that, in the absence of obvious transporters for the major substrates and intermediates of energy metabolism, these molecules must be transported across the glycosomal membrane via pores formed by known glycosomal membrane proteins, which are orthologues of the peroxisomal membrane proteins PEX11, GIM5A/B, PXMP4, PEX2 and PEX16. The paper is well-written and the technical approach is appropriate. While one must be mindful of the adage “absence of evidence is not evidence of absence”, the comprehensive nature of the proteomic analysis in the present study provides a persuasive argument (albeit, not definitive proof) for this conclusion. As a minor point, it could perhaps have been helpful to have indicated the identity of the proteins enriched in the glycosomal membrane fraction (urea pellet) of Table 1B. It would also be good to indicate what proportions of the total glycosomal fraction are represented by the two lanes in this figure. I have read this submission.

In addition to dermopathy, patients may also exhibit debilitating musculoskeletal and neurological manifestations resembling the symptoms of Lyme disease1,2. Similarities were found between MD and bovine digital dermatitis (BDD), a disease common in dairy herds and characterized by keratin filament formation in skin lesions that frequently occur above the hind feet of cows3,4. Chronic BDD lesions demonstrate proliferation of long keratin filaments, and microscopic examination of histological sections from this tissue has revealed the presence of various Treponema spp. among enlarged keratinocytes throughout the stratum spinosum and dermal papillae5–9.The etiology of BDD is considered to be multifactorial with coinvolvement of spirochetes and other bacterial pathogens10–14. In the animal disease, repeated detection of spirochetes from lesions and sero-reactivity to Borrelia burgdorferi antigens provides evidence of spirochetal involvement10–14. Successful experimental infection with tissue homogenates and pure cultured treponemes has confirmed that spirochetes are primary etiologic agents15,16.Like BDD, MD filaments are produced by epithelial cells and stem from the stratum basale and from the root sheath of hair follicles, thus providing evidence that the filaments are cellular in origin3,4. Furthermore, immunohistochemical and histological staining has demonstrated that these filaments have a collagen as well as a keratin component5,17. Like cattle with BDD, patients with MD also produce antibodies reactive to Borrelia burgdorferi antigens18. Multisystemic symptoms resembling Lyme disease also imply a possible spirochetal etiology for MD1–3,18,19. The frequent clinical diagnosis of Lyme disease and coinfecting tick-borne pathogens in MD patients suggests a multifactorial etiology and possible vectoring by ticks1–3,18,19.In light of the proven spirochetal association with BDD and the possible association with MD, we undertook a histological, electron microscopic and PCR study of MD dermatological tissue samples to investigate the presence of spirochetes in these samples. In addition, bacterial culture was conducted to investigate the possibility of viable spirochetes in MD tissue.","03 Apr 2013","Approved - Disclosure Comment","John English, Department of Dermatology, Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, UK","Author Response 11 Mar 2014"," It would be nice to know if treating the Borrelia helped the Morgellons disease?Publisher’s note added on 19 Apr 2013: Since the publication of this referee report, a potential conflict of interest has come to light.

Based on these data, human allogeneic HLA-identical mesoangioblasts are in a phase I/II clinical trial for the treatment of paediatric patients affected by Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD; EudraCT no. 2011-000176-33). However, human mesoangioblasts have a finite lifespan in culture and the need for large cell numbers to treat each patient may impact the therapeutic efficacy of this approach, especially if this treatment should be extended to adults. To address and overcome these issues, the concept of deriving patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that could serve as a platform for the genetic correction of autologous cell therapies in the future is being explored5.Developments in the generation of iPSCs have advanced significantly in the past 6 years6,7; however, concerns related to potential tumorigenicity, incomplete and inefficient terminal differentiation8, as well as immunogenicity of iPSCs9 and in particular their differentiated progeny remains to be fully elucidated. Immune rejection represents a significant hurdle not just for allogeneic cell therapies, but for all cell therapy approaches, and questions surrounding the potential immunogenicity of iPSCs and their derivatives have been largely overlooked. A recent study provides evidence that syngeneic mouse iPSCs are more immunogenic than their embryonic stem cell (ESC) counterparts9. Immune responses against the integrated viral vectors9 as well as allogeneic10 and mutated mitochondrial genome after long term culture11 of iPSCs have been reported. Moreover, rejection of syngeneic mouse iPSCs following transplantation in vivo into mice9 highlights the fact that even autologous iPSCs can be recognised by the immune system and will be subject to standard rejection mechanisms12,13. Therefore, characterising the interactions between iPSC-derived differentiated cells and immune cells and determining whether or not these cells are recognised and rejected by the immune system is critically important.To explore these possibilities, we utilised a novel protocol to derive mesoangioblast-like cells (human iPSC-derived mesoangioblasts: HIDEMs) initially from healthy iPSCs and subsequently from iPSCs reprogrammed from skeletal muscle cells of Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy, Type 2D (LGMD2D) patients14. These cells, as expected, exert similar myogenic potential as normal mesoangioblasts, which makes them candidates for future clinical application. Here, we examined the effect of HIDEMs derived from both healthy donors and LGMD2D patients on immune cells in vitro and compared them with conventionally generated mesoangioblasts from healthy donors. Importantly, we demonstrate that HIDEMs from both sources do not induce, but rather suppress mitogen-driven T cell proliferation in vitro. Moreover, consistent with our findings for adult skeletal muscle-derived human mesoangioblasts15, HIDEMs mediate their immune suppressive effects through indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE-2).","24 Feb 2014","Approved","Mayana Zatz, Human Genome and Stem-Cell Center, Institute of Biosciences, University of São Paulo, Brazil",NA," In this study Li, English et al. propose that HIDEMs behave in a very similar manner to mesoangioblasts, with regard to expression of HLA and co-stimulatory molecules, suppressive potency and mechanisms of action. HIDEMs are comparable to mesoangioblasts in their surface marker expression and that both cell populations respond to stimulation with pro-inflammatory cytokines consistently, with increased expression of HLA-ABC, HLA-DR, PD-L1 and low level expression of CD40. Importantly, HIDEMs suppress T cell proliferation driven by anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation in a similar dose-dependent manner as that of mesoangioblasts, but with increased potency. Comparable to mesoangioblasts, HIDEMs did not alter the expression of early activation markers CD25 or CD69 on CD3+ T cells, a phenomenon also seen with immune-suppressive mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC). These findings are comparable to other publications by the same group. The activation step involving IFN-<U+03B3> or TNF-a is an apparent prerequisite for HIDEM suppression of T cell proliferation as neutralization of either cytokine significantly abolished the inhibitory effect. IDO and PGE-2 are identified as key mechanisms of action involved in HIDEM suppression of T cell proliferation. Following this line of thinking we suggest that other potential suppressive mechanisms should be investigated. The involvement of regulatory cytokines like IL-10, TGF-ß for example should be addressed, as well as the more detailed phenotype of T cells or even the participation of T regulatory cells should be explored. The detailed study of immunological mechanisms is highly relevant and may contribute to advance our knowledge about the use of HIDEMs or mesangioblasts for the therapy of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

Effective clinical teaching and learning of PES requires appropriate teaching and learning techniques and assessment methods2. KIST Medical College (KISTMC), Lalitpur, Nepal, is a newly established medical school in the private sector and admitted its first batch of students in November 2008. It follows the curriculum of Tribhuvan University Institute of Medicine (TU-IOM), Kathmandu, Nepal3. The curriculum stresses early clinical exposure with the first year being devoted to the acquisition of history taking and communication skills and the second year to physical examination skills. The curriculum recommends involvement of the departments of Medicine and Surgery in PES training (PEST) for second year students as part of early clinical exposure (ECE). The methods for teaching/learning and assessment are not well defined in the curriculum.The project was developed to make teaching-learning of PES structured, and involved eight clinical departments using appropriate teaching, learning and assessment methods. Students are provided with an opportunity to learn basic physical examination skills in gynecology and obstetrics, orthopedics, ear, nose and throat (ENT), ophthalmology and pediatrics, as well as general medicine and surgery in their second year Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery degrees (MBSS) so that they get sufficient time to learn reasoning, diagnostic, procedural, therapeutic and counseling skills during their clinical years (third, fourth and final year). The objective of the project was that at the end of the second year, students should be able to initiate and perform a basic physical examination of an adult suffering from medical, surgical, gynecology and obstetric, orthopedic, ENT and eye diseases, as well as a basic physical examination of a child.","07 Jun 2013","Approved with Reservations","Bruce Fisher, Division of General Internal Medicine, University of Alberta, Canada","Author Response 08 Jun 2013"," Title and Abstract: The title is acceptable and clear.Article content: The authors are to be applauded for their thoroughness and attention to accepted pedagogical models when designing and setting up their curriculum.

Respiratory infection transmission can be described as either droplet or airborne. Droplet transmission relates to larger particles that are expelled and rapidly settle to the ground, usually within 1 minute of production1. Droplet transmission therefore relies on relatively close proximity to the source case. These larger particles are generated from the upper respiratory tract during coughing or sneezing or during procedures such as suctioning or bronchoscopy2. Larger particles tend to deposit on external mucus membranes or high up in the respiratory tract. Settled droplets can also contribute to fomite transmission. Airborne transmission is caused by smaller expelled particles which can stay suspended in the air for long periods exposing a greater number of contacts at greater distance1–3. They are formed by the re-opening of closed airway passages, which de-stabilise the mucous surface layer4. These smaller particles penetrate further into the lower respiratory tract to alveolar level. It is not possible to define a cut-off particle diameter at which aerodynamic behaviour changes, however, the World Health Organisation use a 5 µm cut-off to distinguish between airborne and droplet transmission5.Recently, the development of optical particle counter (OPC) technology has enabled researchers to measure both the density and the full spectrum of sizes of expired droplets, from the submicron level to larger droplets6,7. Studies using that technology have demonstrated that the majority of particles produced during normal breathing and talking are of submicron size. Although coughing and sneezing can produce 5 times more particles than normal breathing7, the latter accounts for the majority of expired bio-aerosols over the course of a day4,7–9. In addition, recent studies have shown that submicron particles exhaled during normal breathing can contain respiratory viruses6,10,11, suggesting that submicron particles could contribute to infectious disease transmission. The relative contributions of droplet and airborne transmission to the spread of different infections remains controversial but there is increasing recognition that airborne spread may be more important than previously thought for the transmission of respiratory viruses such as influenza12–17. For tuberculosis for example, airborne transmission is regarded as obligatory as mycobacteria need to reach alveolar levels to be taken up by macrophages18.Early mathematical models of the spread of infectious diseases have tended to assume that infected individuals were largely homogenous within their age group with respect to transmission19,20. More recent modelling work shows substantial heterogeneity in transmission of SARS, measles, monkey pox and pneumonic plague21 suggesting the occurrence of “super-spreaders” of respiratory infections. Previous small-scale studies of exhaled particle production suggest that two distinct populations of particle producers exist: the majority of individuals are low producers (exhaling an average of less than 500 particles per litre during normal breathing) and a few are high producers (producing more than 500 particles per litre)4,7. It has been hypothesised that high level producers of exhaled particles (so-called “super-producers”) may be “super-spreaders” of respiratory infection. To date published studies of exhaled particle production have included small numbers of individuals, limiting the ability to describe the range of particle production and factors associated with high production and have not examined the long-term stability of exhaled particle production within individuals. For example one study with 16 volunteers22 examined the stability of exhaled particles only over the course of 2 months.This study aimed to explore the characteristics of exhaled particle production in healthy individuals, its stability over time, and factors associated with high levels of particle production. Findings from this study may have implications for theories and models of infectious disease transmission through the respiratory route.","06 Feb 2013","Approved","Adam Hill, Department of Respiratory Medicine, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, UK",NA," A well written article with interesting findingsI would recommend the authors alter the statement that 'high particle production was associated with older age'- the multivariable analysis showed that it was in the group aged 40-49 that was statistically significant but not in the group aged 50+In the multivariable analysis it specifies that it took account of the medical history- did this take account of the treatments patients had e.g. inhaled corticosteroids etc?The authors state that 'measurements repeated within a session were relatively stable with good agreement between particle counts (concordance coefficient rho ranging from 0.3 to 0.65, p<0.01)'.

Such changes have been observed in the past 150 years and supported by modeling results for the longer term, e.g., warming ocean water, shrinking mountain glaciers, retreating snow cover, and CO2 concentration dynamics in Arctic/Antarctic ice cores2–6. It is projected that the global temperatures will increase by an average of 3°C with a range of 2 to 4.5°C under the scenario of doubling atmospheric CO2 concentration by the end of the century2. Global climate warming will likely have profound and diverse impacts on biological systems2,4–13.Increases in CO2 and temperature to a certain extent should have positive impact on photosynthesis and growth, as the current atmospheric CO2 concentration is below the saturation point for RuBisCO (Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase)14. Furthermore, higher CO2 concentrations suppress photorespiration and increase the partitioning of photosynthetic electron transport to carboxylation14. However, the situation will become complicated if the temperature goes beyond plants’ ability to acclimate, or when the rate of temperature increase exceeds the pace of acclimation. In such cases, temperature and CO2 will have opposite effects on photosynthesis, i.e., the higher temperature induced increase in photorespiration may exceed the beneficial effect of CO2 elevation, resulting in a decline in net photosynthesis. Consequently, the direction and magnitude of change in net photosynthesis will be determined by the relative magnitudes of the two opposite effects15. Kirschbaum16 has conducted a theoretical analysis on the dependence of photosynthesis on temperature and CO2 concentration for C3 plants and found that at 35°C, photosynthesis at the ambient CO2 concentration reaches only 50% of the rate at saturating CO2 concentration, whereas the corresponding value at 5°C is 77%. Therefore, there is greater potential photosynthetic enhancement by CO2 elevations at higher temperatures. This theory has been supported by the results of a number of studies15,17–19. Long20 has suggested that the increase in atmospheric CO2 will not only increase photosynthetic rate, but also alter the photosynthetic response to temperature. Mooney et al.21 indicate that the photosynthetic acclimation to elevated temperature and CO2 mainly involves changes in the heat stability of the thylakoids and RuBisCO activity. Hence, high temperature and CO2 elevations may have synergistic effect on photosynthesis and CO2 elevations may lead to improved acclimation to high temperatures. However, such interactions may vary with plant species22,23 and other environmental conditions. Variations in acclimation ability can change the interactions within and between species and the composition and functioning of plant communities under future climatic conditions. Furthermore, in most past studies, high temperature treatments are achieved in one step, which is in contrast with the gradual, progressive increases in temperature occurring in global climate changes.The boreal forest is an important terrestrial ecosystem with a high carbon sequestration potential24. As the global climate change accelerates, the boreal forest has been experiencing progressive increases in temperatures and CO2. The response of the boreal forests could have great impact on the global carbon balance25. White birch is one of the most widely distributed tree species in the boreal forest. The growth conditions of white birch in northwest Ontario are characterized by a long cold winter and short summer. For example, the annual mean temperature in Thunder Bay region is 2.4°C while the January and July average temperatures are -14.9°C and 17.6°C (based on Environment Canada’s online weather records for the time period of January 1943 to December 2003). Nevertheless, based on our past experience in growing white birch seedlings in greenhouses, it appears that the species is capable of acclimating to continuous warming to more than 40°C in the early afternoon on sunny summer days (see Figure 1). In this current study, we test the hypothesis that CO2 elevation will enhance the photosynthetic performance of white birch seedlings growing in a progressively warming environment.Figure 1. Time course of temperatures in the greenhouses during the experimental period (March 1 through August 15).(A) Postmeridian (hour) pattern between 13:00 and 16:00; (B) Diel (hour) pattern between 0:00 and 24:00.","01 Jul 2013","Approved","Christian Koerner, Institute of Botany, University of Basel, Switzerland","Author Response 03 Jul 2013"," Having stated that the work makes a very sound impression to me and reflects state of the art methodology, I still have concerns about the implied meaning.

However, why would one make such measurements if not for the implied meaning for growth and overall performance? From all what we know to date, such a link has not been shown outside horticultural conditions. It will be most unlikely that a birch seedling in the wild is carbon limited. Whatever the photosynthetic performance, such a seedling would only incorporate structural carbon to the extent nutrients permit, and these are finite per unit land area (except for N) and are competitively foraged for.

It serves as a scavenger of reactive oxygen species generated under adverse environmental conditions. However, AA also influences flowering time and senescence1–3, pathogen disease resistance2,4, the biosynthesis of various plant hormones5–7, and root development8–11. This suggests that AA and some of its intermediates have functions in addition to its antioxidant properties.Ascorbic acid biosynthesis in plants occurs predominantly through the d-mannose/l-galactose pathway12,13. Given the multifaceted functions of AA in plants, there is a need to advance our understanding of how plants regulate the biosynthesis and accumulation of AA. Arabidopsis thaliana mutants deficient in AA have provided important insights into the breadth of molecular and physiological functions of AA. One of the Arabidopsis mutants, vtc1-1, contains a defect in the AA biosynthetic enzyme GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase. The mutant was originally generated by ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) mutagenesis of Col-0 wild-type seed14. The vtc1-1 mutant contains a point mutation in amino acid 22 that converts a conserved proline into a serine15. The VTC1 gene has recently been shown to be a determinant of ammonium sensitivity in plants. In the presence of ammonium, vtc1-1 mutants exhibit strongly reduced root growth in comparison to the wild type, a phenomenon that is independent of AA deficiency8–11. To better understand the mechanism through which VTC1 mediates conditional ammonium sensitivity, it is important to identify regulatory partners of VTC1. To accomplish this, we undertook a suppressor mutagenesis approach of vtc1-1 homozygous mutant seed in the hope of identifying vtc1-1 suppressor mutants that could then be isolated and studied.One of the suppressor mutants isolated in the M0 generation, svt2 (suppressor of vtc1-1 2), contained wild-type AA levels and developed roots similar to the wild type in the presence of ammonium. However, while characterizing the mutant genotypically, we observed that it lost the original vtc1-1 mutation (i.e., svt2 contained the homozygous wild-type allele). Furthermore, we determined that svt2, although generated through EMS mutagenesis of Col-0 vtc1-1 mutant seed, was phenotypically and genotypically similar to Ler. Intriguingly, a small percentage of svt2 M1 plants produced offspring that have phenotypic and genotypic similarities to Col in the M2 generation. Even more remarkably, a small percentage of Col-like revertants in the M2 generation produced progeny that exhibited phenotypic and genotypic svt2 characteristics again in the M3 generation.Phenotypic instability of Arabidopsis alleles affecting a disease resistance gene cluster has recently been reported16. In their work, Yi and Richards described that exposure to EMS or through the generation of different F1 hybrids induced phenotypic instability in the bal and cpr1 mutant alleles. The authors later proposed that the high phenotypic instability is caused by a genetic mechanism17.The presented study focuses on describing and characterizing the Arabidopsis svt2 suppressor mutant and its phenotypic and genotypic behavior. After illustrating the phenotypic features of svt2, we investigate transgenerational changes in the phenome and genome of svt2 and provide evidence that svt2 is a true mutant and not the result of an experimental artifact or contamination. Finally, we discuss our experimental findings in respect to the vtc1-1 mutant background and other reports that previously described similar phenomena of genome instability and restoration, and we briefly speculate on possible mechanisms of phenome and genome instability in svt2.","31 Jan 2013","Not Approved","David Oppenheimer, Department of Botany, University of Florida, USA",NA," In this paper, the authors characterize a suppressor of the vtc1-1 mutation, which they named svt2. The authors characterize the phenotype of the vtc1-1 mutants that carry the suppressor mutation and show that the plants have characteristics reminiscent of the Ler accession. Molecular characterization of the suppressed plants show that the suppressor mutation is apparently a reversion of the original vtc1-1 mutation, and surprisingly, have additional genomic signatures of the Ler ecotype as well as additional mutations.  There are several problems with the experimental methods used in this manuscript. First, according to Figure 1 of the manuscript, the authors screened the M0 generation (the mutagenized seed) for wt ascorbic acid content. This is a significant problem for the subsequent mutant analysis in this manuscript. When Arabidopsis seed are mutagenized, the individual cells of the meristem on the seed are mutagenized independently. When the seed germinate, the plants are genetic mosaics. In addition, only those mutations in the L2 layer that gives rise to the germ cells will pass on the mutations. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that a seedling with wt ascorbic acid levels would be isolated from the M0, because it would take the accumulation of many independent mutations, each of which would need to lead to suppression of vtc1.  It is possible that a large sector of an M0 seedling could contain a suppressor mutation that leads to wt ascorbic acid levels, but this sector would have to include cells in the L2 layer for the mutation to be passed on to the next generation. Also, an Ler-like sector should be obvious on a mostly Col-0 plant. Nonetheless, a sector that included the L2 would lead to segregation of the phenotype in the M1 generation, because the cells in the sector would be heterozygous for the suppressor mutation.  Second, the concentration of EMS commonly used for mutagenesis in Arabidopsis (0.2%) is known to cause multiple mutations per genome. When one isolates a mutant of interest from an EMS screen, one should back-cross it at least once to allow these other mutations to segregate away. Otherwise, one may observe unexpected results when analyzing the mutant of interest due to the effects of these other mutations.  Third, when analyzing the sequence of the vtc1 gene in the original mutant and in the suppressor, svt2, the authors compared the sequence to the Ler and Col-0 sequences reported in Genbank and TAIR. Instead, the authors should sequence the vtc1 gene from their original vtc1-1 stock and the Ler accession that is present in their lab. This is because it is known that nucleotide polymorphisms arise regularly in lab stocks such that a comparison between a lab stock of Col-0 and the reference sequence can show many differences. Because the authors are reporting unexpected sequencing results, they should show the actual sequence traces (from both strands) for the individual base pair differences highlighted in Figure S1. It would be appropriate  to show these sequence traces in the supplemental data. Showing the sequencing traces for the base pair differences would demonstrate that the sequence differences are not due to ambiguous base calling or other sequencing errors.  Fourth, the authors refer to the suppressed plants and their revertants has having a Ler-like or Col-like phenotypes. Because the phenotype of vtc1 is lower ascorbic acid levels, and the putative suppressor has wt ascorbic acid levels, the ascorbic acid levels in the revertants should be measured to show that they are revertants, instead of relying on the Ler or Col phenotype. Fifth, because seed and pollen contamination can explain the results, the authors need to explicitly state the degrees to which they tried to eliminate these possible sources of contamination. Were plants of more than 1 genotype grown together? Were seeds of more than 1 genotype collected in the same room? Was soil stored where plants were setting seed? etc.  The single, Ler-like seedling found in the M0 population can be explained as an Ler seed that contaminated the Col-0 vtc1-1 seed stock used for the mutagenesis. This can be tested by sowing several thousand Col-0 vtc1-1 seed from that seed stock, and screening them for the presence of any Ler contaminants.  The results in Table 4 are the same as one would expect from seed contamination: the svt2 plants (with the Ler phenotype) have all Ler markers, and the revertants (with the Col phenotype) have all Col markers. The svt2 Col R1 M2 plant highlighted in red shows the expected results if the parent of that plant was heterozygous for Col/Ler. Again, the authors should state what extraordinary measures they used to eliminate seed and pollen contamination.  Once these comments are addressed, the other unexpected results can be examined in a new light. I have read this submission. I believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to state that I do not consider it to be of an acceptable scientific standard, for reasons outlined above.

Lymph node and visceral manifestation is seen in cases of strong immunosuppression or aggressive disease1. The four clinico-epidemiological forms of KS are: a classic form typically affecting elderly men of the Mediterranean, the endemic presence in Southern Africa, the epidemic form in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the iatrogenic KS complicating iatrogenic immunosuppression2.KS is strongly associated with human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8), which is implicated in the pathogenesis of all forms of KS3. HHV-8 is present in the vast majority (> 90%) of spindle cells and in the neoangiogenic vessels4–6. It is considered to be a necessary, but not sufficient causal agent of KS. Besides immunosuppression and AIDS, additional cofactors remain unknown7.Ensoli et al.8 speculated that early stage KS is a reactive inflammatory angiogenic process that may be triggered or enhanced by infection with HHV-8 with many lymphocytes and monocytes infiltrating the lesion. These cells produce inflammatory cytokines including interferon-y (IFN-<U+03B3>), tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß), IL-2, IL-6 and others9. The inflammatory cytokines induce the recruitment of circulating cells into tissues, induce the production of angiogenic factors that mediate angiogenesis and edema and activate endothelial cells to acquire the phenotype of KS spindle cells10.Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are an evolutionarily conserved component of the innate immune system that defend against invading bacteria, viruses and fungi through membrane or metabolic disruption11. This diverse group of peptides is separated into several classes. Defensins and cathelicidin (also known as LL-37) are considered the two main groups of AMPs in human skin12. It was confirmed that human ß defensin (HBD)-3 and LL-37 demonstrated the ability to inhibit viral infection, affecting both enveloped RNA and DNA viruses and non-enveloped viruses13–21. Moreover, beside their role in protecting the host from the invasion of pathogens, HBD-3 and LL-37 have immunomodulatory properties in inflammatory skin diseases as psoriasis22,23 and rosacea24.Based on the antiviral and immunomodulatory effect of HBD-3 and LL-37, as well as the angiogenic role of LL-3725, this study was carried out to assess the expression of the two main antimicrobial peptides (HBD-3 and LL-37) in skin lesions of KS in comparison to normal skin from healthy subjects.","19 Nov 2012","Approved with Reservations","Barbara Ensoli, Director, National AIDS Center, Istituto Superiore di Sanit, Italy","Author Response 17 Dec 2012"," In this study the authors have evaluated for the first time the expression of human ß defensin (HBD)-3 and LL-37 in cutaneous lesions of KS and showed that these antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are significantly up-regulated in KS skin lesions as compared with skin of healthy controls. The results are of potential interest to the understanding of KS pathogenesis, however there are several points that should be addressed which can improve the work.1. The authors should explain why they excluded from the immunohistochemical evaluation macular lesions considering that these lesions are the one with the highest degree of inflammatory infiltrate, and given the role of the peptides in inflammatory skin diseases.2. It is not clear how the scoring for the immunohistochemical analysis was calculated (see Material and Methods section). In particular it seems that a total epidermal score (ranging from 0 to 7) was obtained by the addition of a score representing the extension of the expression detected in the four epidermal layers with an intensity score, which represented the average intensity of positive epidermal cells. Then the percentage of positive cells is calculated, and a grading from 0 to 4 was assigned. Finally, the authors stated that, because KS lesions frequently showed significant intraspecimen heterogeneity, a score was calculated in which the percentage positive rating was multiplied by the intensity rating. Each component of the lesion was scored independently and the results were added up, so how were all these scorings were combined? Which are the scores indicated in Table 1-3? Finally, it seem that the scoring was done in the open and this may represent a bias.3. In the Table summarizing the “Demographic, clinical and immunohistochemical scoring of HBD-3 and LL-37 of studied population” it would be important to indicate also the patient clinical stage.4. Figure 1: arrows should be included in panels to point out positive cells, particularly in panels E and I. In addition, in order to correctly compare the expression of LL37 in plaque and nodules, panel I and J should have the same magnification.5. The authors stated in Discussion that the expression of AMPs was increased with progression of KS lesions from plaque stage to nodules. However, to support of the possible role of these AMPs in progression of KS lesions from stage III and IV patients should be studied.6. The manuscript does not cite a paper reporting that human beta defensin-2 (HBD-2) is expressed by endothelial cells present in Kaposi’s sarcoma lesions (but not by endothelial cells present in normal tissues), and that inflammatory mediators induce HBD-2 expression by normal endothelial cells Kawsar et al.

Literature, painting, sculpture, music, anthropology, philosophy and related subjects are used in MH modules throughout the world. MH supports the exploration of the human side of medicine and is the intersection of the arts and medicine1. MH programs are uncommon in South Asia. A voluntary MH module was conducted at Manipal College of Medical College (MCOMS), Pokhara, Nepal2. For the past three years we have also been conducting a MH module at KIST Medical College (KISTMC), Lalitpur, Nepal, first for faculty and medical/dental officers and later for first year medical students3. The module uses small group, activity-based sessions to explore various aspects of the humanities. Case scenarios, role plays, debates and interpretation of paintings are among the different learning modalities used.Role plays have been shown to promote active learning of students and are an experiential learning technique with learners acting out roles in case scenarios to provide targeted practice and feedback to train skills4. In Nepal, the use of role plays in educating medical students is limited. However they have been used in certain institutions. At MCOMS, Pokhara role plays were/are used to teach students to communicate non-drug and drug measures with respect to common conditions/diseases using simulated patients by the department of Pharmacology5. At KISTMC, the department of Clinical Pharmacology uses role plays for the same purpose and to optimize the time spent with medical representatives6. At MCOMS, role plays were used to explore issues of human sexuality during the voluntary MH module and during a session on social issues in the use of medicines7. In New Delhi, Indian medical students had used drama to explore the emotional pressures on the humane dimension of a medical student’s life8.When role plays are used in an unplanned and ad hoc manner, students often report dissatisfaction as active learning is impaired4. However, role plays have many potential uses in medical education. Of special relevance to MH are role plays enabling students to place themselves in situations they have not experienced before, to help them empathize and understand other people’s problems and motivations9.Role plays have been used to teach students the skill of breaking bad news10. The most effective educational interventions present basic steps to delivering bad news and provide opportunities to learners to discuss their concerns, to enable them to practice, and to receive feedback on their skills11. In Germany, video-taped role plays and subsequent analyses are used to teach students the skill of breaking bad news12. At the University of Heidelberg, Germany, introducing role plays enhanced the realism of technical training and improved doctor-patient communication13. In a Malaysian medical school, role plays have been used to teach communication skills in primary care medicine14 and to teach students to obtain a sexual history and discuss sexual health issues15. At MCOMS role plays were used to teach students to critically evaluate drug promotion16.In Nepal, students enter medical school after twelve years of schooling with the subjects of physics, chemistry, biology and English being compulsory during the last two years. Students do not have much exposure to life situations and are emotionally immature. In our institution, early clinical exposure for four hours every week starts right from day one. The scenarios used in the MH module and their interpretation by students using role plays exposed them to situations that they are unlikely to have encountered in their life. MH introduces students to problematic life situations, teaches students to communicate better, and can stimulate creativity and the imagination17. Role plays enable students to place themselves in the situation of another person and may help to develop empathy. Role plays early in the course can expose students to different situations they are likely to face in their future career. Students become aware of social issues and other problems of the country so that they can be more active citizens. In Nepal, other medical schools are slowly adopting role plays for specific purposes in medical education. The Patan Academy of Health Sciences (PAHS) has the mission to train doctors for rural Nepal and community health sciences are an important part of the curriculum18. The institution encourages reflection and is planning to introduce MH in its curriculum.The module for the third batch of students concentrated on five important areas. The first session was on empathy and the second one on ‘What it means to be sick in Nepal’. The other sessions were on the doctor, the patient and the doctor-patient relationship. There was also a concluding session. The module was held on alternate thursdays for around two hours for a group of 50 students. The students were divided into five small groups and facilitator presentations, case scenarios, role plays, paintings, and student presentations and activities (such as identifying learning issues from case scenarios and interpreting them using role plays, interpreting paintings and photographs among others) were among the different teaching-learning modalities used. Student feedback on the paintings used during the module in 2012 has been published19. Use of more paintings from Nepal and South Asia was suggested by the respondents in the study19. Following this study, we are now using paintings by our medical students which were exhibited during an art exhibition in the institution.The content of role plays was often designed around social and political situations in contemporary Nepal. Nepal is recovering from a decade-long conflict and the scars are still visible. Many parts of the country were mined by the two sides and while the problem is not as extensive as in many other nations, land mines can be a danger to innocent civilians. Trafficking of young girls continues to be a problem though many organizations are now active in preventing trafficking and rescuing young girls20. Leprosy and HIV/AIDS continue to be diseases with significant social stigma and the status of women continues to be poor.In the United States of America (USA), ‘The art of doctoring’, was introduced as an elective module to third and fourth year students21. Role plays were used along with other learning modalities. Role plays have also been used to teach appropriate interaction with pharmaceutical company representatives22.Detailed participant feedback on the role plays used in the MH module had not previously been obtained. Hence the present study was carried out with the following objectives:a) To obtain participant feedback about role plays used in Sparshanam.b) To understand problems and difficulties in interpreting and enacting the role plays.c) To obtain suggestions for further improving the use of role plays during future modules.","09 Jan 2013","Approved","Ramalingam Sankran, PSG Institute of Medical Sciences and Research, India",NA,"DOI: 10.5256/f1000research.237.r655 I have read this submission and think that it is a good piece of work done in Nepal.

Indeed, application of knowledge and values of communities that are resident within or around key biodiversity areas has been gaining increasing global popularity as significant elements in enriching and improving strategies for conserving biodiversity2. This is because integration of such indigenous knowledge into conservation programs facilitates cross-borrowing of ideas, promotes constructive engagement, and instills a sense of common ownership and responsibility towards achievement of a synergy of goals3. This echoes the concept of social capital3 that, apart from amassing local support and goodwill, adoption of local indigenous knowledge in conservation may also promote and provide sustainable insurance against conflicts of purposes. This results in increased chances of achieving the dual goal of biodiversity conservation stewardship as well as community development. For instance, studies have shown that rainforest ethno-botanical checklists prepared by communities living in or near them tend to be more exhaustive because they are based on practical day-to-day uses that are firmly ingrained in local cultural norms and values3–5.Like in many parts of the developing world, there is a growing upsurge in demand for herbal and other traditional remedies for various ailments among communities in Kenya. This is due either to the increasing cost of conventional modern medicine or, inadequacies in public health service delivery6. For a long time, the bulk of “technical” information on traditional plant uses in the treatment of disease has been disparate and privately held, with limited accessibility to the public or peer-review domain7,8. Fortunately, over the past five years there has been an upsurge in research and publication on indigenous knowledge and use of medicinal plants in Kenya. This includes research on medicinal plants of the Nandi forest9, indigenous knowledge on medicinal plants of Mt. Elgon forest10 and the uses of medicinal plants by the Ogiek people of the East Mau forest11. As a result, a firmer foundation is being laid gradually but steadily for further research into the effectiveness of these treatments and the various options for preparation and administration for managing diseases.This study sought to set in motion a process for systematic documentation of plants of medicinal value in the Kakamega forest, with a view to consolidate indigenous knowledge about them and making this information available to the wider community. It is hoped that in the process of this, ecosystem and other socio-economic services offered by the Kakamega forest will be highlighted. The study also sought to highlight any plant species in the forest that may have medicinal value that are also of conservation concern, either as endangered or as invasive species.","09 Jan 2013","Approved","Martin Potgieter, Department of Biodiversity, University of Limpopo, South Africa","Author Response 14 Dec 2012"," I have reviewed the revised manuscript Local indigenous knowledge about some medicinal plants in and around Kakamega forest in western Kenya.

New viruses of the complex and illnesses associated with them are frequently being described from different parts of the world. Human illnesses associated with infections with these viruses include mild or severe encephalitis and hemorrhagic fevers1. Kyasanur Forest Disease Virus (KFDV), a member of the hemorrhagic fever group, was discovered in 1957 in the Shimoga district of Karnataka State, India, where it produced a febrile illness and deaths in humans, and deaths in both species of monkeys, the black-faced langur (Presbytis entellus) and the red-faced bonnet macaque (Macaca radiata), that inhabit the endemic area2. Most of the human infections with KFDV occur in the drier months of the year, with peaks in March and April, and the number of cases is variable, but may reach over 500 in some years. Alkhurma Hemorrhagic Fever Virus (AHFV), described in 1997, a cause of severe hemorrhagic fever in Saudi Arabia and other regions of the Middle East3,4 and Nanjianyin Virus recovered from a febrile patient in Yunnan, China5, are closely related to KFDV. Omsk Hemorrhagic Fever Virus (OHFV), which is endemic in western Siberia, Russia, and recognized as a tick-borne flavivirus in 1947, is distantly related to KFDV1. In addition to the hemorrhagic fevers noted above, viruses of the TBEV complex are also responsible for over 10,000 cases of encephalitis, annually, in Europe and Asia, and for localized illnesses in different parts of the world1.In 1958–59, a formalin-inactivated mouse-brain virus vaccine prepared with the heterologous Russian spring-summer encephalitis virus (RSSE) was administered to over 10,000 residents in the KFDV-endemic area. Although this vaccine was protective against KFDV challenge in the mouse model6, it was completely ineffective in preventing human KFDV infections in the endemic area7. It also failed to prevent KFDV infections in laboratory personnel8,9. Serologically, individuals immunized with the RSSE vaccine showed a barely detectable immune response to KFDV antigens10. In contrast to the lack of effectiveness of an inactivated RSSE vaccine, an inactivated KFDV vaccine reduced the incidence of KFDV in the affected area11. Thus, KFDV infections in humans were preventable by an inactivated homologous vaccine, but not by an inactivated heterologous vaccine.In the late 1950s and 1960s, investigators from the Virus Research Centre (VRC) [now the National Institute of Virology (NIV)] in Pune, India, conducted infection and challenge experiments in non-human primates using virulent and tissue-culture-adapted (TC-adapted) strains of KFDV as well as Langat virus (LGTV), a related virus of the TBEV complex isolated from ticks in Malaysia12. The results of these studies were described only in the annual reports of the VRC and in a doctoral thesis published in 19636, so they are not readily available. Because data obtained from experimental infection and challenge of non-human primates with viruses of the TBEV complex are valuable and may help efforts aimed at developing prophylactic vaccines, we have combined the information from the doctoral thesis and from an unpublished manuscript (Bhatt and Dandawate, unpublished observations, 1971) for this report.We show here that 1) KFDV produces a high-titered viremia and death in both species of monkeys that inhabit the endemic area, 2) a TC-adapted KFDV has markedly reduced virulence for both monkey species, and 3) monkeys previously infected with TC-adapted KFDV or with heterologous LGTV completely resist challenge with virulent KFDV. Together, these data lend support to the idea that in contrast to the inactivated vaccines that do not cross-protect, an attenuated live virus vaccine derived from a member of the TBEV complex may be broadly protective against the different viruses of the complex.","19 Dec 2012","Approved","Alexander Freiberg, Department of Pathology, University of Texas Medical Branch, USA",NA," I have read this submission.

Still it was estimated that 7.2 million children under the age of five died in 2011 mostly because of treatable and preventable causes2. Continued success towards achieving the Millennium Development Goal to reduce child mortality by two-thirds of the 1990 rate depends on renewed efforts to prevent and control pneumonia, diarrhoea, malaria and malnutrition1,3. UNICEF, the World Health Organization (WHO), and their technical partners, have developed the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) strategy, consisting of three components: improving the case management skills of health workers; improving the health system support needed for effective management of childhood illness; and promoting key family and community practices through the education of caretakers and other members of the community4.The Bellagio Child Survival Study Group and the Lancet Neonatal Survival Team have identified and evaluated 31 newborn and child preventive and treatment interventions5,6. Breastfeeding intervention emerged as the most important single intervention in terms of prevention, showing that if it is implemented with 90% coverage, it could reduce 13% of all under-five deaths. According to the Countdown Report (2010), the median coverage of exclusive breastfeeding in the 68 Countdown countries was only 34%1. Antibiotics for pneumonia was identified as a treatment intervention, that if implemented with 99% coverage could reduce under-five mortality by 6%5,6. According to the Countdown Report (2010) the median coverage of antibiotics for pneumonia in the 68 Countdown countries was 27%1. Although substantial progress has been made in reducing mortality and improving coverage, two major challenges remain: how to improve the quality of health interventions, and how to reach the most disadvantaged children7,8.There is limited evidence on the process of implementing effective child health interventions, their cultural appropriateness, cost-effectiveness, and effects on health inequalities, all of which are important considerations for policy-making9. It is not only a matter of how many children are receiving effective interventions; the quality with which these are delivered is also critical10. To encourage the full implementation of health interventions, international recommendations need to be adapted locally, taking into account the political environment and the socio-cultural context. For that to happen, there is a need to evaluate how interventions are implemented, and which factors help and hinder their success. Child health interventions may vary substantially in the degree of effort to implement them, as implementation barriers may differ for different interventions. Every intervention requires for its implementation and sustainability both financial and non-financial resources that vary in terms of quality and quantity, known as intervention complexity11.The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility to scale up exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months, antibiotics for pneumonia and IMCI child interventions in selected communities of the Cusco region, Peru.In pursuing this purpose, the constraints, synergies and possible solutions to the implementation of these child interventions have been systematically assessed according to the conceptual framework developed by Gericke et al.12.","08 Jan 2013","Approved","M.

The outermost portions of the telomeres consist of telomerase-encoded simple-sequence repeats rich in G residues as read in the 5´ to 3´ direction toward the end of the chromosome. Fission yeast telomeric simple-sequence repeats appear, at first sight, to be more complicated than those of other organisms1, but analysis of motif frequencies2 and analysis of the sequence of the fission yeast telomerase template RNA3 show that the simple-sequence repeats consist mainly of the heptamer GGTTACA with variable numbers of additional G residues (due to polymerase-template slippage) and variable extents of template-coded spacer sequences.At the ends of most chromosomes, telomere-associated sequences (TAS) are located internal to the simple-sequence repeats1. In all fission yeast strains, TAS are found at both ends of the two larger chromosomes (1 and 2). Chromosome 3 contains arrays of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) repeats near both ends. In some strains, these rDNA repeats directly abut the simple-sequence repeats1, while in other strains there are TAS between the rDNA and the simple-sequence repeats at one or both chromosome 3 ends1,4,5. The complete TAS array consists of approximately 50 kb, forming large inverted repeats at the ends of chromosomes 1 and 2 (Figure 1A). Most of this sequence is ""unique"" (except for the fact that each cell contains 4–6 copies of TAS), but there are clusters of direct repeats within the first 3 kb and also 4 to 6 kb away from the telomere (Figure 1B, C). Within the reference Schizosaccharomyces pombe genome sequence of October, 2008 (ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk//pub2/yeast/pombe/Chromosome_contigs/OLD/20080922), only the right end of chromosome 2 extended sufficiently close to the telomere to include any of these direct repeats. The ends of the other chromosomes were less completely sequenced. Fortunately, the right end of chromosome 2 provides an excellent model for the structure of the other chromosome ends (Figure 1A).Figure 1. Comparison of telomere-associated sequences (TAS) at the ends of fission yeast chromosomes 1 and 2.(A) The October, 2008, versions (ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk//pub2/yeast/pombe/Chromosome_contigs/OLD/20080922) of the nucleotide sequences from the ends of fission yeast chromosomes 1 and 2 were aligned with each other on the basis of restriction map similarities and Pustell DNA matrix alignments using MacVector software (http://www.macvector.com/). The left ends of chromosomes 1 and 2 were reverse-complemented so that their sequences would have the same polarity as those of the right ends of chromosomes 1 and 2. The green arrows show the locations and orientations of documented genes (dubious and pseudo genes were omitted). The orange arrows show regions of high sequence similarity between the four chromosome ends. The positions of deletions and an insertion within these highly similar regions in the ends of chromosome 1 (compared to the ends of chromosome 2) are shown by additional orange arrowheads (deletions) or a gap in the orange arrow (insertion). Thin black guide lines are also provided, to facilitate the alignments of similar sequences despite the presence of deletions and an insertion. The far right end of chromosome 2 overlaps for about 4 kb (panel C) with the left end of pNSU21, a clone of a 7992-bp telomeric HindIII fragment prepared by Neal Sugawara1. Here we have used the reverse-complement of the pNSU21 nucleotide sequence, as determined partially by Neal Sugawara1 and completely by the Sanger Centre fission yeast sequencing project (ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk//pub2/yeast/sequences/pombe/telomeres). We have employed the reverse complement (and we’ve changed the numbering correspondingly) so that (i) the pNSU21 sequence would have the same orientation as the right end of chromosome 2, and (ii) so that the G-rich strand of the simple-sequence repeats would be the top strand, read from 5´ to 3´. In this numbering system, the simple-sequence repeats are at nucleotides 7881–7992. The HindIII site at position 1 of pNSU21 is not shown in the diagram. The only restriction sites shown are BamHI, NsiI, PvuII, SacI, and XhoI. These have been given distinct colors to enhance the reader’s ability to perceive similarities between restriction site patterns. A thin vertical line at the right of the diagram shows the estimated position of the simple-sequence repeats for all four chromosome ends. In other words, this line provides an estimate of how far the nucleotide sequence of each chromosome end would extend if the sequence were established all the way to the telomere. (B) A Pustell DNA matrix diagram was prepared (using MacVector software) of pNSU21 against itself, in order to identify significant internal repeat sequences. The conditions employed were: window size 20, minimum % score 100, hash value 6, jump 1. Two families of direct internal repeats were identified. These are called ""Telomere-Proximal Repeats"" (TPR). The TPRs closest to the telomere are called TPR1, while those further from the telomere are called TPR2. The line of sequence identity is colored blue. (C) A Pustell DNA matrix diagram was prepared of the right end of chromosome 2 against pNSU21, using the same conditions as in (B). The blue line shows the region of (near) sequence identity. Approximately 3840 nucleotides would need to be added to the sequence of the right end of chromosome 2 for it to reach the simple-sequence repeats. The TPR2 family of internal direct repeats is included in the sequence of the right end of chromosome 2.Moser et al.6,7 have shown that the replication forks emanating from the most telomere-proximal origins in fission yeast reach telomeres asymmetrically, with the leading strand polymerase arriving about 20 minutes ahead of the lagging strand polymerase. The lagging strand delay appears to provide an opportunity for differential processing of the leading and lagging strands at the telomere. What could be the mechanism of this telomere-specific replication fork asymmetry? There may be something special about the replication origins located closest to telomeres, or cis-acting sequences that accelerate leading strand synthesis and/or decelerate lagging strand synthesis (perhaps in collaboration with bound proteins) may be located between telomere-proximal origins and the telomeres themselves. In either case, it would be of great interest to identify and characterize the telomere-proximal replication origins in fission yeast.Kim and Huberman8 previously used two-dimensional (2D) agarose gel electrophoresis to study the origin function and replication timing in fission yeast of the TAS-derived telomere-proximal HindIII restriction fragments (bounded by a HindIII restriction site on one side and a telomere on the other side; 7–8 kb each). They found that these fragments were replicated in late S phase. They also observed that these fragments usually produced only Y-arc signals, indicative of passive replication by forks from a centromere-proximal origin or by forks from an internal origin close to one of their ends. Occasionally, however, bubble-arc signals indicative of active origin firing within the middle portions of the fragments were also observed. These results suggested that the replication origins closest to telomeres in fission yeast may be located within these HindIII fragments. In this paper, we describe our characterization of two replication origins located in the centromere-proximal 30% of the HindIII fragments. These two late-firing origins appear to be the closest origins to the telomeres.Late telomere replication has also been observed in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae9–12. In budding yeast cells treated with hydroxyurea (HU), lateness of telomere replication is maintained by the Rad53-dependent replication checkpoint13.In this paper, we report our investigation of the causes of late telomere replication timing in fission yeast. In agreement with previous studies8,14–16, we found that the replication check-point regulates telomere replication timing in fission yeast as in budding yeast. In addition, we found that late replication appears to be a consequence of cis-acting sequences located between the two telomere-proximal replication origins and the telomere itself.","17 Dec 2012","Approved","Jurg Bahler, Department of Genetics, Evolution & Environment and UCL Cancer Institute, University College London, UK","Author Response 19 Dec 2012"," I have read this submission.

More than 850 human miRNAs have been cloned and bioinformatic predictions indicate that mammalian miRNAs can regulate approximately 30% of all protein-coding genes4–6. The expressionof many miRNAs is specific to a tissue or developmentalstage, and the miRNA expression pattern is altered during thedevelopment of several diseases7,8.Studies measuring small numbers of miRNAs have shown their presence in circulating blood; specifically in platelets9, plasma10, and mononuclear cells11. In studies examining specific miRNAs12,13, differential expression was noted both in hematopoietic cell lines13 and between human and mouse cells12. Interestingly, miRNAs have been detected in cell-free human plasma preparations14. They have been found to be stable and protected from endogenous RNase activity14. In addition, levels of a specific miRNA (miR-141) can distinguish patients with prostate cancer from healthy controls14.Basic studies have shown that miRNAs regulate cardiac differentiation, angiogenesis, and myocyte growth15,16. Small clinical studies have also shown that levels of specific miRNA have been correlated with myocardial infarction in cardiac tissue from humans17 and animal models18,19. A recent study examined one miRNA (miR-1) from plasma and related it to acute myocardial infarction10. In stable and unstable coronary artery disease patients, 157 miRNAs were measured from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and differential expression was found11.As shown by these studies, there are some publications about circulating miRNAs in cardiovascular disease9,20. In addition, the existing studies are restricted by incomplete evaluation of currently known miRNAs. Available arrays are constrained by incomplete miRNA coverage, issues in discriminating between closely related miRNAs, as well as ongoing discovery of new miRNAs (and the inherent lack of flexibility of the array platform). In addition, miRNA arrays have poor reproducibility when across clinical populations or in larger samples sizes21. We have developed a combined method of miScript miRNA assays (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) and Dynamic Arrays (Fluidigm, South San Francisco, CA) that employs quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) using a high-throughput process that allows us to analyze more samples vs. more miRNAs in a very short time22. Lastly, unlike hybridization-based microarray profiling techniques, qRT-PCR is considered the gold standard for RNA expression and does not require further confirmation analysis. Using this platform, a complete analysis of circulating whole blood, cellular, and cell-free miRNA was performed. The relevance of these findings to coronary disease was determined by measuring plasma miRNA expression in patients presenting for coronary angiography. The findings suggest that the distinct patterns of miRNA expression in components of whole blood may reflect specific patterns of disease.","11 Jan 2013","Approved","Jennifer Clancy, Genome Biology Department, John Curtin School of Medical Research, ANU College of Medicine, Biology & Environment, The Australian National University, Australia","Reader Comment (Member of the F1000 Faculty) 12 Jun 2013"," I would like to note that the manuscript could be improved by use of error bars in Figures 1 and 2 to display some measure of variance and that future studies of this type could utilise spike-ins prior to RNA extraction to normalise for variability in RNA extractions between samples.

The college admitted its first batch of students in November 2008 and four batches of students have been admitted since. A medical humanities (MH) module has been conducted for first year medical students right from the first batch1 using small group, activity-based learning methods. Case scenarios, role plays, facilitator presentations and paintings are among the different modalities used to explore various aspects of MH2,3.The first author had used literature excerpts during a voluntary module for medical students and faculty members at the Manipal College of Medical Sciences (MCOMS), Pokhara, Nepal4. Literature excerpts were also used during a module conducted for faculty members and medical and dental officers at KISTMC5. Problems were noted with the use of literature excerpts. The excerpts were in English and were mainly obtained from the book ‘Ten years of the medicine and the arts’6 published by the Association of American Medical Colleges. Participants felt the excerpts did not reflect the Nepalese scenario, the language used was difficult to understand and they could not relate to certain excerpts.Literature has been widely used in MH programs especially in developed nations. At the Northwestern Medical School in Chicago, United States (US) literature is taught in courses from the first day of medical school through residency7. Literature has been used in the MH program at the University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Medicine in the US8 and during a family medicine clerkship at the University of California, Irvine College of Medicine9. In Asia literature from both Western and Arabic contexts has been widely used at the Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar10.Literature has a number of advantages in the education of doctors. It develops skills in observation and interpretation, develops clinical imagination, and promotes clarity of expression7. Literature can foster tolerance for uncertainty inherent in clinical practice, and increase empathy towards patients. A review states that five broad goals are met by the study of literature in medicine. Literary accounts can teach medical students concrete and powerful lessons about the lives of sick people11. Physicians are able to better understand and empathize with narrative stories of patients, literature increases physicians’ expertise in narrative ethics and literary theory can offer new perspectives on the work and genres of medicine.The MH module at KISTMC is named as ‘Sparshanam’ meaning ‘touch’ in Sanskrit, an ancient South Asian language. The 80 students of the 2011 intake were divided into six groups each consisting of 14 or 15 students. The module was conducted for 90 minutes every Thursday during the early clinical exposure for first year students. Eight sessions were conducted from December 2011 to March 2012. The topics covered during the eight sessions were empathy, what it means to be sick in Nepal, the patient, the doctor, the doctor-patient relationship, the family, the medical student and a wrap up session. Literature excerpts were reintroduced in this module and were used during certain sessions. Keeping in mind previous feedback we used excerpts with relatively simple language and which were directly related to Nepal. The excerpts were by western authors and in the English language. Further information about the excerpts used is provided in the Methods section. The present study was conducted in the third week of March 2012 with the following objectives:a. Obtain feedback on the literature excerpts used andb. Get suggestions for further improvement.","17 Dec 2012","Approved","Avinash Supe, Gordhandas Sunderdas Medical College, King Edward Memorial Hospital, India",NA," I have read this submission.

To date, more than 140 mutations linked to fALS have been identified in sod1. Some of these mutants are enzymatically functional2, consistent with the idea that mutant sod1 results in a toxic gain-of-function rather than the loss of SOD1 activity3. This is further supported by studies of a mouse model where deletion of sod1 does not cause ALS-like motoneuron disease4,5.Besides motoneurons, glial cells have also been known to play a role in SOD1-linked ALS. Using chimeric animals, Clement and colleagues showed that mutant SOD1 expressed in motoneurons survived significantly longer and delayed degeneration if the neighboring cells did not express mutant SOD16. Other investigators demonstrated that wild type MN neighbored with microglia and macrophages expressing mutant SOD1 underwent degeneration and contained ubiquitin-positive inclusions7,8. Yamanaka and colleagues showed that expression of wild type SOD1 outside of MN delayed the onset of the disease and extended the lifespan of transgenic mice up to 50%9. These experiments support the notion that fALS is a non-cell autonomous disease process where glial cells play a critical role in the progression of ALS.Several hypotheses have been proposed to account for non-cell autonomous mechanisms of ALS. Loss of the excitatory amino acid glutamate transporter (EAAT2) in astrocytes may cause glutamate-dependent excitotoxicity promoting disease progression10. Higher inflammatory response from microglia mediated by mutant-expressing astrocytes11 or inability to regulate glutamate receptor subunit 2 expression in motoneurons by mutant astrocytes12 have also been suggested as mechanisms for ALS development. Finally, release of unknown toxins by astrocytes as evidenced by rapid death of embryonic stem cell-derived motoneurons when co-cultured with mutant expressing glial cells also has been suggested13,14. These studies point to the importance of bilateral interactions between astrocytes and motor neurons in ALS development and progression.In addition to genetic inheritance of fALS, environmental agents have also been identified as causes for ALS. ß-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) is a non-specific amino acid that was found in the post-mortem brain samples of the people of Guam who developed amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/Parkinson-dementia complex (ALS/PDC) during the 1940s15,16. BMAA is generated by cyanobacteria and can be found in many aquatic and/or terrestrial ecosystems and is believed to accumulate in living organisms by a process called biomagnification17. Ross and colleagues reported behavioral changes in mice in response to intracerebroventricularly administered BMAA; these mice were hyper-excitable followed by whole body shaking/wobbling18. Intracranially injected BMAA caused injuries of hippocampal neurons in mice19. Using a cell culture system derived from spinal cord tissues of 13-day old mouse embryos, Rao and colleagues suggested that BMAA was selectively toxic to motor neurons via the AMP/Kainate receptor20. Lobner and colleagues have also proposed that BMAA is an agonist for NMDA and mGluR5 receptors because BMAA induces oxidative stress in cultured mouse cortical neurons21.Increasing oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS) either by the herbicide paraquat or by excessive levels of hydrogen peroxide may also enhance neurodegeneration22–24. Paraquat has been implicated in Parkinson’s disease22,25,26 and in ALS. In a case-control study of ALS in northern Italy, Bonvicini and colleagues found that compared to age- and sex-matched controls, more ALS patients had experienced occupational pesticide exposure in excess of 6 months27. There was an increased risk of ALS among employees of the Dow Chemical Company who were exposed to the herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid versus other Dow employees28. Paraquat showed a decrease in ubiquitously expressed survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) in the human cell line NSC34, implicating oxidative stress in the mechanism of ALS underlying SMN1 deficiency in familial ALS and potentially sporadic form of the disease29. More recently, TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) has been implicated in the etiology of sporadic ALS30. Using human neuron culture, Ayala et al. showed that H2O2 (10 µM) caused accumulation of TDP-43 in the cytosolic fractions, a condition presumably linked to pathology of ALS31.BMAA, paraquat, and hydrogen peroxide are also known to have debilitating effects on motor activity and longevity in fruit flies25,32,33. Pesticides were shown to cause complete or partial chromosome loss in repair-defective female Drosophila34. The effect of paraquat on longevity is best studied in fly models of Parkinson's disease35. Flies mutant for DJ-1 showed striking sensitivity to agents such as paraquat and rotenone36. Islam and colleagues have shown a significant loss of dopaminergic neurons when these flies were treated with either 500 µM rotenone or 10 mM paraquat37. Flies mutant for the glial lazarillo, which codes for the homologue of human Apolipoprotein D, also showed significantly reduced lifespan under paraquat treatment38. BMAA was found to be a glutamate agonist, reduced lifespan, impaired motor activity, and caused memory deficits in fruit flies39. Mekdara and colleagues recently also have reported a BMAA-induced decline in locomotion in a dose-dependent manner in Drosophila40. More recently, fruit flies fed with BMAA were shown to cause prolonged open state of the NMDA receptor channel41, suggesting a conserved molecular pathway for BMAA toxicity from mammals to flies.How BMAA, paraquat, and H2O2 interact with mutant SOD1, however, remains unclear. In this report, we aim to understand the roles of mutant SOD1 expressed in different cell types in fly longevity when these flies are exposed to BMAA, paraquat, and hydrogen peroxide. We overexpressed mutant SOD1 in a cell-type specific fashion in flies and then treated them with 3 mM BMAA (in 3% sucrose), 20 mM paraquat (in fly food), or 1% hydrogen peroxide (in 3% sucrose). All three chemicals shortened the lifespan of the flies. However, flies with MN expression of mutant SOD1 lived longer on BMAA-containing food compared to control flies. Interestingly, flies with glial expression of mutant SOD1 died sooner on BMAA. Different from BMAA, H2O2 reduced lifespan of flies further in flies with mutant SOD1 expressed in any of the three cell types compared to controls. Unlike BMAA and H2O2, paraquat reduced longevity to a similar extent in both control flies and flies expressing mutant or wildtype SOD1. Hence, our results reveal a novel role for glial mutant SOD1 in mediating BMAA toxicity and a surprising role for motor neuronal mutant SOD1 in resisting BMAA toxicity. Furthermore, mutant SOD1 enhances H2O2 toxicity in shortening fly lifespan.","26 Nov 2012","Approved","Grace Zhai, Department of Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, USA",NA," This is an interesting article.

False positive alarms have multiple causes, including ‘low threshold’ settings, motion interference, and false signals generated from a variety of clinical activities. Paradoxically, the high rate of false positive (80–99%) alarms trains practitioners to ignore alarms2,3. Alarm fatigue is a phenomenon where practitioners come to ignore alarms3. In many ICUs, the audible signals from the alarms built into their bedside monitors are disabled or silenced. This strategy has reduced the noise pollution associated with these systems without obviously decreasing their performance.Previous literature4 points towards the need to reduce the total number of alarms that occur in working environments such as the ICU. One strategy to increase the clinical utility of such alarms is to specify alarm definitions that are less sensitive, but have a high positive predictive value (PPV). Based on Signal Detection Theory5 strategies to accomplish this could include higher thresholds for alarm conditions, and advanced alarms that might be less likely to be triggered by either artifact or clinical activity. Higher thresholds would alarm less often, but would also alert caregivers later in the course of a patient’s decompensation. Importantly, setting the threshold for an alarm at a higher value may not substantially change the rate of false alarms from artifacts. Alarms with a higher positive predictive value would be triggered less often, and would be much more likely to summon bedside caregivers to respond appropriately. The greatest risk from this strategy is that an alarm might not sound when a life threatening condition is present.Another strategy to reduce the rate of false alarms is to increase the sophistication of the alarm software6, in effect, making the monitor analyze data across sensors to verify the alarm condition. For example, when a patient moves, she can disturb her EKG electrodes and produce an EKG signal that appears to be ventricular fibrillation. In this instance, the EKG alarms 'V fib'! Frequently, however, other sensors are generating information that could be used to suppress that false alarm.The correlation of information across sensors may be especially effective in reducing artifact related false alarms. For example, either an arterial line or a pulse oximeter might detect a pulse in the above patient, which is impossible in the setting of V fib. By comparing information across sensors, smarter monitors might decrease the rate of false alarms and facilitate the early detection of other clinical problems. Similarly, a patient who is tachycardic should have a high heart rate on their EKG, pulse-oximeter, and arterial line (if one is present). Simply correlating information from these different sensors is likely to decrease the rate of false alarms without reducing sensitivity to a clinically important degree. The presence of alarms triggered by a single sensor is an artifact of device history, not deliberate design. Advanced software could be programmed to replicate the logic that caregivers utilize to discriminate real conditions from artifact.Another strategy to increase response to alarms is to assess parameters that are clinically important in the context of the abnormal parameter. For example, tachycardia associated with a precipitous decline in blood pressure is almost always clinically more significant than tachycardia associated with no change or an increase in blood pressure. Advanced alarms which alert bedside caregivers to important patterns of change (clinical correlations) are far more likely to generate the desired clinical response than monitors that continually alarm for situations that represent little or no danger. Such alarms would have a high PPV, lower rate of false alarm, and are likely to elicit more purposeful responses from caregivers.In this study, we utilized Philip’s Event Monitoring software to define alarm conditions that correlated information across sensors, and which were prospectively intended to have a high positive predictive value. The software being studied in this trial is intended to serve both of these purposes, and the data collected during this trial will inform its refinement.The Clinical Study of the Event Surveillance Software/Event Alarming usability and functionality is a feedback collection and comparative multi-center study of the recently released Philips' D. O. software for Intellivue Monitors (MP70/90). The software was designed to detect scenarios that are either harmful or might predict a critical situation for the ICU patient.","27 Nov 2012","Approved","Gorazd Voga, Medical ICU, General Hospital Celje, Slovenia",NA," The ideology behind the research of this article is good and relevant.

Potentially deleterious effects that are seen with blood storage–including, but not limited to, declines in 2,3-DPG and ATP, as well as increases in potassium content and in free hemoglobin and iron (due to hemolysis of red cells)–have been termed the “storage lesion”1,2. Our limited understanding of the significance of this storage lesion or storage-induced physiological changes is at the root of a current debate about the efficacy of using long-stored blood. Reports of post-transfusion complications, such as multiple organ failure, sepsis, and even small general increases in morbidity and mortality, have fueled much concern1,2, but clinical investigation has yielded conflicting opinions about the actual impact of the age of blood on transfusion outcomes. Some studies suggest that transfusion with stored blood results in greater post-operative complications than transfusions with fresh blood because of the deleterious effects of storage3–5. However, several other studies have presented results that indicate no definitive difference between transfusion outcomes with fresh blood or aged blood6–8, or if there is an effect, it is probably small9,10. Infusing stored blood with augmented 2,3-DPG and ATP has resulted in improved transfusion outcomes11, and a similar approach is now being considered to target other potentially deleterious biochemical changes.Among the observed adverse effects of blood transfusions, reduced oxygen delivery and reduced vasodilatory capabilities of stored RBCs are considered especially critical factors1,2,12. It is now known that one of the primary vasodilators and regulators of blood flow is the endothelium-derived relaxing factor, nitric oxide (NO)13. Substantial production of NO occurs within tissues via several mechanisms. Initially, conversion of L-arginine to NO was thought to be primarily via endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)14–16 and to a lesser extent, via neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) enzymes17. It has recently been realized that, in addition to NOS synthesis, nitrite reduction to NO may be catalyzed by the enzymatic action of xanthine oxidoreductase, nonenzymatic disproportionation, and reduction by deoxyhemoglobin in blood and by other heme-proteins in various tissues18–23. Indeed, nitrite ions may be the major storage pool of NO bioactivity. On the other hand, erythrocytic hemoglobin is a major sink for the destruction of NO, and cell-free hemoglobin is an even more effective sink for NO24. Clearly the physiological and potentially pathological effects of red cell transfusions will be affected by any changes in these NO synthetic and destructive processes prior to, during, and immediately after red cell administration.Currently, there is interest in the investigation of potential clinical consequences of changes in NO derivatives during storage, especially with respect to oxygen delivery and vasodilatory capabilities of transfused blood, as well as any association with transfusion-related complications. Two approaches to this have surfaced from our understanding of the metabolism of NO. In one, the nitrite/NO pathway is implicated-nitrite is a major storage pool of NO that can interconvert directly or indirectly with NO. In fact, studies on platelets have elucidated a functional role of nitrite as a modulator of platelet aggregation under hypoxic conditions25,26. In another approach, S-nitrosylated hemoglobin (SNOHb) is implicated-indeed, it was proposed that the amount of SNOHb is responsible for the quality of stored red cells, and that replenishing SNOHb would be therapeutically helpful, supposedly restoring the oxygen-transport and vasodilatory capabilities of RBCs. However, this theory has been questioned on several grounds20,27–29. Evaluation of NO availability with respect to hemoglobin-mediated reductive mechanisms thus appears warranted.In the present study, we quantified the main nitric oxide metabolites–nitrite and nitrate–as a function of duration of blood storage. We investigated blood stored under standard blood bank protocols, as well as blood stored in an argon chamber, to prevent gas exchange with the surrounding air. We also addressed the role of enzyme inhibition in NO metabolite composition in stored blood. Our results demonstrated a stable nitrate concentration throughout storage but a gradual decline in nitrite concentration after the initial rapid destruction upon venisection. Stored blood consistently maintained low levels of nitrite until the end of storage. The potential implications of these results for blood transfusion therapies are discussed.","12 Nov 2012","Approved","Jay Zweier, Davis Heart & Lung Research Institute, The Ohio State University, USA","Author Response 19 Nov 2012"," Overall this research article is well written and clear for the most part.

Current models suggest that these patterns are critical for proper regulation of T cell activation. T cell recognition of an APC bearing cognate peptide drives the formation of a structure termed the immunological synapse (IS) or supramolecular activation cluster (SMAC)1. In a ""mature"" synapse, many proteins important for transduction of TCR signaling concentrate at the center of the contact site, the central supramolecular activation cluster (cSMAC), between the T cell and APC. These proteins include CD3, CD28, ZAP-70 and PKC-<U+03B8>1–3. At the IS, this concentration of signaling proteins may enhance signaling before engaged TCR’s are internalized, possibly to terminate signaling4.Opposite the immunological synapse is a region known as the distal pole complex (DPC). Many large adhesion and glycosylated molecules, such as CD43, are transported to this region4,5. Formation of the DPC is thought to be driven by ERM (ezrin, radixin, and moesin) family proteins6,7. The prevailing hypothesis is that the DPC serves as a reservoir for sequestering negative signaling molecules, such as CD43, away from the IS to allow for greater T cell activation8. However, the presence of a pool of active signaling molecules, including ZAP-70, PIP3, and STIM-1 and Orai1 suggests an additional positive role for the DPC9–11. While the precise function of the DPC is disputed, formation of the DPC does appear to impact T cell activation. For example, disrupting localization of proteins to the DPC with an ERM dominant negative construct can disrupt specific functions, including transcriptional activation and cytokine production6,12.Transmembrane immunoglobulin and mucin 1 (Tim-1) is a co-stimulatory molecule found on the surface of many immune cells. It was first identified in primates as a Hepatitis A virus cellular receptor (HAVCR1), although the mouse homolog does not bind HAV13. Variants in murine (and human) Tim-1 were later associated with asthma susceptibility14–16. Early work on the immune function of Tim-1 also revealed a role for Tim-1 as a co-stimulatory molecule on CD4+ T helper cells by enhancing inducible transcription, cytokine production, and proliferation17,18. Tim-1 has also been implicated in the regulation of B cells, CD8+ T cells, dendritic cells, NKT cells, and mast cells19–26. Tim-1 antibodies have demonstrated efficacy in the modulation of immune function in different models of disease, including asthma and organ transplantation17,19,22,27–30.Although much is known about the effects of Tim-1 on transcription factor induction and cytokine production, less is known about the sub-cellular localization of Tim-1, especially in T cells. The function of many molecules has not been fully appreciated until their localization was understood. For example, the role of PKC-<U+03B8> in T cells was greatly enhanced by the discovery that it localizes at the SMAC in effector T cells and away from the IS in regulatory T cells31,32. Understanding Tim-1 localization in T cells may provide similar insights into its function, particularly since some controversy still exists about the role of Tim-1 in T cell signaling. While previous studies have implicated Tim-1 in enhancing T cell activation17,18,33,34, one report has suggested that Tim-1 might function in either a positive or negative fashion, depending on the strength of antibody ligation35. Another recent study demonstrated increased cytokine production by Tim-1 deficient T cells, suggesting that Tim-1 may also act as a negative regulator of T cell function, at least under some circumstances36. Thus, defining Tim-1 localization on T cells under different conditions may yield novel insights that help to resolve these apparently disparate findings.The localization of Tim-1 has not been extensively explored. A previous report suggested that Tim-1 exists in vesicles in the cytoplasm of human embryonic kidney cells (293) and 300.19 pre-B cells37. Another study demonstrated that Tim-1 expressed on DO11.10 TCR transgenic T cells localized towards apoptotic thymocytes with exposed phosphatidylserine (PS), a Tim-1 ligand24. Other studies have suggested that human TIM-1 interacts with ZAP-70 and PI3K33 and may co-cap with CD335.At this point, relatively little is known about the sub-cellular localization of Tim-1, especially in T cells. In particular, where Tim-1 distributes (or re-distributes) upon T cell activation is poorly characterized. In this study, we define the patterns of Tim-1 localization before and after T cell recognition of antigen/MHC, as well as the functional consequences of altering Tim-1 localization. Our studies have revealed unexpected complexity in the regulation of Tim-1 localization and its function in T cell activation. These findings may have implications for understanding the function of Tim-1 in regulating immune responses.","19 Oct 2012","Approved","Wenxia Song, Department of Cell Biology and Molecular Genetics, University of Maryland, USA","Author Response 30 Aug 2012"," I am now satisfied with the changes that have been made by the authors, and these revisions have made an improvement from the first version of the article.There are a few other minor concerns that the author may want to be consider;1.

""The learning environment created in the training group is crucial in helping trainees take risks while feeling supported""1. Student’s perception of learning, their teachers, the learning atmosphere, and their academic and social self-perceptions are major components of the DREEM (Dundee Ready Education Environment) questionnaire developed for studying the environment of medical education2. Many medical colleges in India are now taking initiatives to find out remedial measures to be taken to improve the learning environment3.Developing trusting relationships is one of the components of a model for self-directed learning1. The need for a comprehensive faculty development initiative in institutions is emphasized among the various strategies that are directed to improve teaching practices in medical schools. Faculty development projects are hence included for Curriculum Innovation Projects in FAIMER Fellowship programs. A ""Comprehensive faculty development, which is more important today than ever before, empowers faculty members to excel as educators and to create vibrant academic communities that value teaching and learning""4.Comprehensive faculty development could be done by using the Transactional Analysis (TA) theory of personality development (see What is TA). It can be the basis for bringing about faculty development by facilitating their understanding of their own teaching styles by practice of the TA tools. Transactional Analysis belongs to the humanistic school of psychology1. The International Transactional Analysis Association explains ""Educational transactional analysis is used by practitioners working in training centers, preschools, elementary and high schools, universities, and institutions that prepare teachers and trainers as well as in support of learners of all ages to thrive within their families, organizations, and communities."" (see About TA Transactional Analysis), TA describes a theory of the structure of personality – Ego state (P-A-C-) model (see Key Ideas in TA) and how people communicate with each other based on this structure. Since education is an area of intensive interpersonal processes, practicing self-awareness using this model is known to help develop self-awareness (herein after referred to as ‘awareness’)5. The dynamics of how self-awareness leads to self-directed improvement in teaching is illustrated in figure 1.Figure 1. Dynamics of self-awareness and self-directed behavior change.A survey conducted among students in our institution to find out their perceptions about the existing system of medical education and suggestions for improvement revealed many lacunae in the teacher-student relationships that form a barrier to learning and thus contribute to a poor learning environment (Marina Rajan Joseph, Student Perceptions about Learning Environment in a New Medical College in Kerala, Unpublished document).

The yeast Candida albicans is an opportunist fungal pathogen which can be present as a normal part of body’s microflora3. Candida albicans displays a variety of virulence factors which aid colonization and persistence in the body. One of the most important of these factors is the ability to adhere to host tissue using a variety of mechanisms. The importance of adherence may be illustrated by the ability of Candida albicans to adhere to various mucosal surfaces and to withstand forces that may lead to its removal from the body such as the bathing/washing action of body fluids. A hierarchy exists among Candida species indicating that the more common aetiological agents of candidiosis (C. albicans and C. tropicalis) are more adherent to host tissues in vitro than relatively non-pathogenic species such as C. krusei and C. guilliermondii4. Systemic fungal infections (fungemias) including those by Candida albicans have emerged as important causes of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients (e.g. AIDS, cancer chemotherapy, organ or bone marrow transplantation). Candida albicans biofilms may form on the surface of implantable medical devices. In addition, hospital-acquired infections by Candida albicans have become a cause of major health concerns.Calderone (2002) stated that Candida albicans is commensal and a constituent of the normal gut flora comprising microorganisms that live in the human mouth and gastrointestinal tract. C. albicans lives in 80% of the human population without causing harmful effects, although overgrowth of the fungus results in candidiasis (candidosis)5. Candidiasis is often observed in immunocompromised individuals such as HIV-infected patients. A common form of candidiasis restricted to the mucosal membranes in mouth or vagina is thrush, which is usually easily cured in people who are not immunocompromised. For example, higher prevalence of colonization of C. albicans was reported in young individuals with tongue piercing, in comparison to non-tongue-pierced matched individuals6. Long term untreated infection of Candidiasis in women can block the fallopian tubes hence resulting into infertility among couples. To infect host tissue, the unusual unicellular yeast-like form of Candida albicans reacts to environmental cues and switches into an invasive, multicellular filamentous form, a phenomenon called dimorphism1. Candida albicans produces a range of extracellular enzymes that facilitate adherence and/or tissues penetration. Phospholipase A, B, C and lysophospholipase may function to damage host cell membranes and facilitate invasion. C. albicans produces a range of acid proteinases which have been shown to aid adherence and invasion but which also play an important role in the degradation of the immunoglobulins IgG and IgA. The proteinases have a low pH optimum and this may assist the yeast colonization of the vagina, which is a low pH environment. Haemolysin production by C. albicans has also been documented and seems to be important in allowing the yeast access to iron released from ruptured red blood cells7. An important immune evasion tactic of this organism is the ability to bind to platelets via fibrinogen-binding ligands, which results in the fungal cell being surrounded by a cluster of platelets. Candida albicans is capable of giving rise to a variety of inter-convertible phenotypes which can be considered as providing an extra dimension to the existing virulence factors associated with this yeast. A number of switching systems have been identified and phenotypic switching may have evolved to compensate for the lack of variation achieved in other organisms that utilize sexual reproduction. Phenotypic switching allows the yeast to exploit micro-niches in the body and alters a variety of factors (example is antifungal drugs resistance, adherence, extracellular enzyme production), in addition to the actual phenotype and so may be considered as the ‘dominant’ or controlling virulence factor.According to Sheehan et al.8 investigation which stated that in terms of tissue colonization and invasion, adherence is the initial step in the process. Once the yeast has adhered, enzymes (phospholipase and proteinase) can facilitate adherence by damaging or degrading cell membranes and extracellular proteins. Hyphae may be produced and penetrate layers of cells using thigmotropism to find the line of least resistance. The passage through cells is undoubtedly aided by the production of extracellular enzymes9. Once endothelial cells are reached, enzymes may assist in the degradation of tissues and allow the yeast to enter the host’s bloodstream, where phenotypic switching or coating with platelets may be used to evade the immune system. While in the bloodstream the haemolysin may function to burst blood cells and release iron, which is essential for growth. Escape from the bloodstream involves adherence to the walls of capillaries and passage across the wall. This work is thus undertaken to evaluate the antimicrobial effectiveness of common disinfectants on Candida albicans isolated from five abattoirs displaying tables in Port Harcourt, Nigeria. This is to enable us determine the most potent of the test disinfectants to be used to sanitize these tables before any meat product is displayed for sale to avoid contamination of the meat products.","08 May 2013","Approved","Astrid Mayr, Department of Hygiene, Microbiology and Social Medicine, Division of Hygiene and Medical Microbiology, Medical University Innsbruck, Austria",NA," I think this is an interesting manuscript which provides good information about basic hygienic issues, like disinfection and prevention of infection.

Much attention has been devoted to mapping and quantifying ES to achieve the dual goals of protecting biodiversity and human well-being. A growing number of broad-scale mapping studies aim to identify priority regions for conducting more localised place-based management of ES [e.g.,2–5]. Place-based management requires intensive collection of detailed socio-economic and biophysical data, and close collaboration with stakeholders for effective decision making6,7. Given limited resources and information, and increasing threats to ecosystems, it is not possible to do these comprehensive analyses everywhere in a timely manner. We argue that there is currently an under-appreciated, but vital role for spatial prioritization of locations in which place-based management should occur so that attention is focussed on those locations where resource investment will yield the greatest return for human well-being. Indeed, data are deficient in most locations for informing comprehensive and accurate analyses of trade-offs in ES management, and spatial prioritization is a crucial precursor to attempting such trade-off analyses so that data mining efforts occur in the most critical locations. Moreover, prioritization is essential because much ES management is conducted by government or non-government organizations (NGOs) that could potentially operate in many places.Given the important role that broad-scale prioritization can play in guiding decisions about where to conduct place-based ES management, a critical assessment of current prioritization approaches is warranted. Some schemes for identifying spatial priorities for managing ES are simple characterizations of biophysical processes and social demand, with little consideration of important information such as the availability of alternatives to ES for meeting human needs, threats to service provision, and the costs of management actions. Although fundamentally different to spatial prioritization for biodiversity conservation, spatial prioritization of ES may be guided by some of the key principles of the former. Spatial prioritization for conservation is well established and may be applied at coarse (e.g., biodiversity hotspots or priority ecoregions;8) or fine scales, identifying locations or actions in locations that are relatively more important for protecting biodiversity than other actions or other locations9. As with spatial prioritization of ES, spatial prioritization for conservation may help to identify locations where more detailed systematic conservation planning should be conducted, and is just one component of the planning process10,11.Spatial prioritization of ES differs from spatial prioritization for conservation because ES are valued primarily for their worth to humans, can be transferable across space (may not need to be protected at a specific location), are sometimes substitutable by human engineering, and service beneficiaries define the success of management actions. Yet, as with spatial prioritization for conservation, spatial prioritization of ES can guide decsions about local-scale planning and inform the allocation of resources from management agencies (e.g., World Wildlife Fund;12). Moreover, spatial prioritization for conservation is a useful starting framework for ES prioritization because the former is well entrenched in planning discourse13 and yields valuable lessons for ES management14.Current approaches to identifying spatial priorities for managing ES apply different prioritization methods (see Table 1), and developing more consistent and comprehensive methods is an important goal for future prioritization studies. We review past approaches to spatial prioritization of ES, identifying key aspects that should be considered in future analyses. At appropriate places we discuss the relevance of spatial prioritization for biodiversity conservation to spatial prioritization of ES because certain aspects, such as accounting for costs and threats, are common to both. We then demonstrate the importance of these aspects through a conceptual framework for prioritization that outlines an approach for managing the most vital ES for the least cost where they are most needed15. We illustrate the framework with a worked example using the ES of water provision. Egoh et al.14 reviewed the extent to which ES were included in conservation assessments (˜ identifying spatial priorities). Our work differs from Egoh et al. by assessing how ES priorities have been identified and how methods for prioritization should be improved. It also complements discussions of other aspects of ES management such as how to operationalize ES on the ground16, developing appropriate payments for services schemes (e.g.,17,18) or how to manage service provision at specific sites [e.g.,19,20].Table 1.

Holland et al.48 used four indicators of river status – environmental quality index, taxon richness, habitat quality assessment and habitat modification index – to represent the capacity of river systems and catchments to provide freshwater ecosystem services. The authors argue that changes in the value of these indices reflect changes in the capacity of river systems to provide services such as maintaining water quality, controlling sedimentation and erosion, mitigating floods, cycling nutrients, and filtering pollutants. 2. Carbon stored in soils and vegetation. The authors conducted analyses at different grain sizes (4 km2 and 100 km2) and different spatial extents (Britain/England and 100 × 100 km squares across Britain) and examined variation across regions within Britain. 3. Annual income. 4. The gross margin is the value of outputs minus variable costs and subsidy payments. 5. Recreational use of the countryside. 6. The number of day leisure visits as a measure of the recreational value of particular rural locations (this measure could be interpreted as the demand for recreational services). 7. Amount of carbon sequestered each year. 8. Nitrogen and phosphorus removed in particular landscapes. 9. Capacity of land to retain sediment. 10. Combining information on nest sites, floral resources and bee flight ranges to estimate pollinator abundance and likely visitation to agricultural areas. 11. The authors set targets to address the issue of demand (e.g., capturing 50% of total carbon stored in an ecoregion). 12. Costs are represented by the suitability of areas for conservation based on numerical values that reflect the degree of impediments to conservation success. For carbon storage it is a flat cost; the area of the planning unit. 13. Averted risk of extreme floods. 14. The fraction of total flood control value, as a function of the number of housing units in the floodplain. 15. Production of forage for grazing rangeland stock. 16. Dollar value of forage production. 17. The target was 75% of forage production value. 18. The sum of weighted values associated with developed land, agriculture, road density and length of human-induced patch edges. 19. Provision of recreation opportunities. 20. Quantity of suitable habitat in addition to accessibility issues and rights to access. 21. A baseline target (assumed minimum requirement) of 12 days of outdoor recreation per person per year. 22. Crop pollination by natural pollinators. 23. The dollar value of agricultural crops benefitting from pollination. 24. 75% of feature value across the ecoregion. 25. The supply of fresh water. 26. 40% of total freshwater use. 27. The authors pursued two approaches, a target-based approach and incorporating ecosystem services as extra costs or benefits in the cost layer. 28. This is a species-based approach so the priorities are based on species and their distribution across the landscape. 29. For example, positive or negative economic value. 30. The magnitude of threats affecting each species based on major land uses. The loss of a species is equivalent to the loss of the service(s) that species provides. 31. Median annual simulated run-off. 32. Groundwater contribution to surface run-off. 33. Hotspots mapped as areas with severe erosion potential and vegetation and litter cover of at least 70% where maintaining the cover is essential to prevent erosion. 34. Soil depth and leaf litter. 35. The authors assessed various scenarios for capturing ecosystem services based on incidental protection through the conservation of biodiversity or the inclusion of spatially explicit data on service distribution using Marxan. In Egoh et al.40, the authors set different target thresholds for capturing certain percentages of service provision for surface water supply, water flow regulation, carbon storage, soil retention and soil accumulation. 36. The authors estimated the amount of each ecosystem service provided by vegetation types under intact and degraded conditions. Measuring the difference between the two is indicative of the threat of degradation to service provision. 37. The cost of conserving a planning unit was equivalent to the value of irrigated cropping or grazing. The opportunity costs of conservation were addressed in terms of lost production. The authors included spatial variability in costs because values are per planning unit. In Egoh et al.40, catchment area is used as a cost layer (larger areas = greater cost). 38. By natural vegetation. 39. The authors examined the relationship between fodder provision and stocking rates to determine the stocking rates that can be implemented without degrading the environment (i.e., sustainable stocking rates). Hence, over-stocking is considered implicitly as a threat to vegetation condition. 40. Groundwater recharge. 41. For example, for flood mitigation. The authors also examined opportunities for service enhancement. 42. Incorporating the density of people who rely on the service (beneficiaries) as density per watershed, and the water–production efficiency as water supply divided by area of watershed. 43. Water supply relative to demand adjusted for the need to redistribute supply within watersheds. Watersheds were supply does not (or only just) meets demand were prioritized. 44. Amount of vegetation cover and rate of vegetation loss with mid-range values designated as priorities. 45. A proxy was used representing resource and maintenance costs (e.g., land acquisition, infrastructure and labour) and considering watershed-level measures of income, population size and area. 46. Financial capacity to pay for alternatives to service provision such as dams and filtration plants. 47. Includes the trade-off between a high level of flood activity (number of floods, duration of floods and area affected) and a high level of impact on human populations (deaths and displacement, and human population density in watershed), and the costs of service protection. 48. As a proportion of all land. The authors examine also the opportunities for service enhancement through landscape restoration. 49. The authors used expert opinion to estimate possible land transformation within the next 5 years. This identified negative and positive changes to service provision. 50. Based on stakeholder preference. 51. The inclusion of stakeholders in the ranking process addresses to a degree the demand for services and/or the value of services to beneficiaries. This is an explicit incorporation of beneficiaries in the process. 52. Based on land management and stakeholder perception. 53. The authors compared the ecosystem-service values to the cost of conserving the natural habitat that underlies their provision. The opportunity cost was calculated as the expected agricultural value of each forested parcel of land. 54. To estimate the economic value of bushmeat the authors used the local market price of a kilo of beef since domestic meat is a possible substitute for bushmeat. This approach implicitly recognises alternatives to service provision. 55. Value for new pharmaceutical products. 56. The authors assumed imminent deforestation outside of core protected areas. 57. Net annual rate of atmospheric carbon added to existing biomass carbon pools (measured using a proxy). 58. The authors’ maximized service provision for a given ecoregion area constraint using optimization methods. Incorporating the issue of area constraints addresses costs, and the maximization goal gets somewhat at demand. 59. Annual production of livestock from grazing on unimproved natural pastures (expressed as tons of meat). 60. Beneficiaries were at the point of production only (where economic benefits are realized). The authors identified production peaks of water provision and grassland production in densely populated biodiversity hotspots, indirectly addressing the issue of spatial variability in demand. 61. Water availability and water use. 62. Only the key points are captured here, see the publication for full details. 63. Scenario analyses explore implications of possible future landscape changes. 64. Estimated through soil loss. Regions with lower potential soil loss were a priority, which implicitly recognises the importance of threats. 65. Water-supply function and flow regulation (mean annual catchment runoff and mean annual groundwater recharge). 66. Identified beneficiaries in the biome through a literature review and expert consultation. 67. Mean carrying capacity of the land incorporating climate, soil type and vegetation. 68. Areas that tourists can see within a 10 km buffer surrounding the major tourist driving routes (see Reyers et al.55). 69. Landslide, flood and drought prevention functions. 70. Landslide prevention considered in terms of landslide hazard; the more hazardous an area the more important it is to keep forest in place (an alternative perception of ‘demand’). Drought and flood prevention reflects water retention capability of forest. 71. Estimated using the proximity to settlements and roads (measures of access for deforestation), and distribution of the number of commercial species of trees (a measure of forest desirability for logging). 72. Carrying capacities for domestic stock expressed as the number of hectares required per large stock unit (hectares values were determined for pristine examples of habitat types). 73. The authors compared the potential delivery of ecosystem services from ‘pristine’ locations to that provided by degraded locations, estimating how landscape degradation may diminish the capacity of locations to provide a given service (an indirect assessment of threat). 74. The authors mapped areas vulnerable to erosion and classified them as high, medium and low erosion hazard. Habitat types provide erosion control where there is a high threat of erosion owing to factors such as topography, rainfall and soil (indirectly addressing the issue of threat). 75. Millions of cubic meters of groundwater recharge per 1-km2 grid cell. 76. A related study by Wendland et al.18 included costs, threats and demand, but it is unclear if these are included in the measure of hydrological importance used in Rogers et al.31. 77. Provision of drinking water to downstream users and irrigation for rice paddies. 78. The authors examined the threats to the biological value of key biodiversity areas (KBAs) based on a ‘human pressure index’ calculated from measures of human population density, road density, fire prevalence and agricultural suitability. They did not directly examine threats to ecosystem-service provision, but did this indirectly by looking at threats to the protection of KBAs, which were ranked based on their hydrological service value. 79. The carbon density of living biomass. 80. The number (and type) of services is a little ambiguous; it appears to be between 9 and 13 depending on the analysis. The authors also conducted analyses at three different spatial scales. 81. Ecosystem service values were expressed in dollar values of land units based on land cover and the services provided by particular land covers. 82. The authors deal with threat(s) to service provision indirectly by modelling the change in ecosystem service value with two alternative development scenarios. 83. The authors calculated the ecosystem-service values ($ value) for 17 different services and recognised variation in the spatial dependencies of services. 84. The authors assessed the vulnerability of biodiversity (‘threat’) and then determined the ecosystem-service value captured in biodiversity templates where low vulnerability is a priority and high vulnerability is a priority. 85. The authors calculated water availability (total and per person) and mapped supply and demand ratios. 86. Water availability per person was referenced against an accepted minimum target (1000 m3) set by the United Nations (hence, this target represents ‘demand’). The authors also calculated the percentage of the population with access to improved water and improved sanitation, and under five mortality per 1000 births. 87. The percentage contribution of carbohydrate and protein-supplying crops to total dietary intake. 88. Service provision is compared to recommended minimum daily intake (2100 kcal per person) and minimum daily intake of protein. 89. Lost agricultural production. 90. Opportunity costs for agriculture and stock. 91. The authors did not calculate water quantity, but used a proxy for the supply of sediment-free water based on population data, land cover and water flow direction. 92. The authors measured downstream users through the downstream populations’ need for quality drinking water, downstream area of irrigated rice fields, and downstream area of mangroves.","04 Oct 2012","Approved","David Norton, College of Engineering, University of Canterbury, New Zealand",NA," This is an interesting article that provides a conceptual framework for prioritizing areas for protecting ecosystem services (ES) such as water provision.The article explores similarities and differences between ES prioritization and biodiversity prioritization, and highlights several key components that need to be considered in prioritizing areas for protecting ES.

Armagh, UK","Grant information: The author(s) declared that no grants were involved in supporting this work.","IntroductionSince emergence in 2005, next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have proven prolific tools in the research setting, permeating a variety of scientific disciplines and demonstrating a range of applications that seems to be limited only by the imagination of the sequencing community. The technology continues to develop at a rapid pace with established instrument manufacturers regularly augmenting their product portfolios and an increasing number of start-up companies promising to disrupt the market. Beyond basic research applications, NGS technologies are now increasingly being applied in the clinical environment, driven partly by their rapid maturation and the arrival to market of smaller, cheaper sequencing platforms.The potential clinical application of NGS has a broad scope ranging from full human genome profiling1 to investigation of the microbiome2 and includes applications such as biomarker discovery, patient diagnosis, prediction of drug response and patient stratification for clinical trials. Such applications often involve the targeted profiling of genes known to be of clinical relevance. These genes harbor diagnostically relevant variants including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and small insertions and deletions (INDELs). Individual genes have previously been interrogated in clinical testing using traditional techniques such as Sanger sequencing however NGS technologies have already begun to supplant the previous tools of choice in these areas, offering increased speed and throughput with reduced running costs.Despite many successes and increasing uptake, the data generated by NGS analyzers is not perfect, with each platform yielding characteristic errors and biases. Furthermore, NGS technologies produce reads that are much shorter than those traditionally produced by Sanger sequencing methods and this can complicate matters further, especially in genomes containing a large proportion of repetitive elements3. The effect of these problems is most visible in large scale studies such as genome-wide sequencing where a recent study reported a 1 million variant platform-based discrepancy for a single genome4. This fact bestows responsibility on both algorithm and software developers and downstream users to develop deep understanding of the various data types and their idiosyncrasies and to apply this appreciation in their analysis and interpretation, in order to correct or compensate for potential errors. Despite forming an area of active research, data interpretation remains an issue and is no doubt a factor in feeding the inertia of many clinical facilities that are reluctant to adopt the new technologies5.Two major computational steps in variant detection from NGS data are read alignment whereby the data are mapped to corresponding locations on a target genome, and mutation calling whereby nucleotides differing from the target genome are assessed and scored on their likelihood of representing a genuine mutation versus an error. While these two stages of analysis may be supplemented with various pre or post processing techniques they represent the most crucial steps and therefore the area of most active software and algorithm development.Aligners of choice have begun to emerge6,7 however their strengths are often application specific and different tools are recommended depending on the sequencing platform and individual study goals. Often there is a trade-off between speed and sensitivity at the read alignment stage with speed sometimes prioritized due to the volumes of data produced by NGS technologies and the corresponding time required for analysis. Aligners can be classified as gapped or ungapped based on their ability to produce successful alignments in the presence of small INDELs. Aligners including BWA8 and Stampy have been shown to produce alignments with a fair degree of success for reads containing a range of INDEL sizes9 however such abilities will vary based on a range of complicating factors including size and location of the INDEL. As well as generating continuous controversy10, the BRCA1 gene presents a particularly interesting set of alignment challenges due to a disproportionately high concentration of INDELs greater than eight nucleotides in length. In fact, 3% of known deleterious mutations in the Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC) database11 fall into this category and represent a significant over-representation when compared to a healthy genome. Furthermore the BRCA1 gene contains multiple areas of high shared identity in the form of tandem repeats, posing another difficulty in achieving accurate read mapping. Challenges like this pose particular difficulties in the clinical setting where errors have the potential to translate to misdiagnosis or mistreatment, directly affecting and endangering the lives of patients. No gold-standard clinical alignment tools yet exist and numerous publicized examples of early translational work appear to base their choice of tool on user-friendliness or availability of a graphical-user-interface rather than assessments of performance. We have investigated the performance of a range of popular alignment tools and assessed their ability to facilitate accurate downstream detection of known mutations with a commonly used variant calling pipeline. Several of these tools are already being used as components of diagnostic workflows in the clinical setting. Here we present data generated using BRCA1 reads created in-silico in a simulated, targeted sequencing scenario. Our findings demonstrate the widely varying abilities of common read alignment tools and their impact on downstream variant calling. Furthermore the results suggest a need for careful and thorough evaluation of the tools used in a particular analysis pipeline by simulation and analysis of data of known constitution.","29 Oct 2012","Not Approved","Mihaela Pertea, McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, USA","Reader Comment 07 Jan 2013"," Our ‘Not Approved’ status still maintains.

I ... Continue reading In this review I make arguments based on some computational evidence in support of Oliver’s experimental design and make some observations on the reviews made by Pertea and Salzberg. I declare conflict of interest since I am involved with one of the alignment software reviewed in Oliver’s paper. I note that Pertea and Salzberg chose not to declare conflict of interest in a similar position.Before going into details, I would like to note that both Oliver in this F1000 article and Pertea and Salzberg in their Do-It-Yourself Genetic Testing paper in Genome Biology make important contribution to advance the use of next generation sequencing for BRCA analysis for the benefit of patients. However, they are approaching the same subject from a different perspective. These differences in perspective are reflected in the review of Pertea and Salzberg.Oliver’s experimental design reflects the fact that he carried out this study in a company considering mutational analysis based on next generation sequencing and that in practice such tests use deep targeted sequencing approaches and not whole genome analysis. Some of the arguments made by Pertea and Salzberg reflect experiences with relatively low depth whole genome or whole exome studies, but as I present some evidence here, deep targeted sequencing needs different considerations.In addition to considering the type of experiment, Oliver considered the mutational profile of the target gene. In some populations one third of inherited breast cancer cases are linked to significant insertions or deletions. The inability of the NGS pipeline to detect long indels would mean that the method fails to screen the third of the target population. Oliver carefully considered variants relevant from this screening perspective. When a patient is diagnosed with deleterious BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations they have to make life-changing decisions that could be as severe as electing for preventive mastectomy or ovariectomy. Consequently, in BRCA screening or any other genetic tests, one cannot afford to have false negative mutations and thus false negatives are the critical evaluation criteria.In the diagnostic analysis of BRCA, all variants are followed up by visual inspection of the underlying data and if necessary they are confirmed by Sanger sequencing. False positives are relevant to the extent they generate wasted effort of following them up. When the false positive rate is high, the wasted effort can offset the economic benefits of using NGS in the first place.Oliver’s experiment simulated deep, PCR primer-based, targeted sequencing data. The Haloplex and the Ampliseq kits are commercially available for BRCA analysis and are examples of experiments producing such datasets. Oliver considered homozygous mutations since only these are relevant from a genetic screening perspective.A key argument made by Pertea and Salzberg is that GATK parameterization strongly influences the results and the false variants rate does not reflect the performance of the alignment algorithms. While this argument is correct for whole genome and even whole exome studies considering both homozygous and heterozygous variants, Oliver simulated deep targeted sequencing and examined homozygous mutations only. Restricting the analysis to homozygous mutations removes significant dependence of the results on GATK parameters. GATK parameterization impacts the results of deep, targeted sequencing experiments differently from that of whole genome sequencing. In order to examine the effect of variant calling parameterization as well as the reasons for false negatives, my colleague Tibor Nagy repeated the experiments in Oliver’s paper using the Bowtie2/GATK pipeline. We examined the false negatives, as well as the dependence of the false positive rates on the GATK parameterization.We have visually inspected the read alignment in the region of all 40 false negative variants produced by the single-end Bowtie2/GATK pipeline. The false negatives can be explained by no coverage for 11 mutations, by low mapping quality for 18 mutations, and by alignment error for 11 mutations. GATK parameterization will only affect one of these categories:(1) The missing variants due to no-coverage will not be found by any parameterization of GATK.(2) Low mapping quality reads supporting missing variants can be recovered by lowering the corresponding threshold in GATK.(3) The alignment error is the most complex category and warrants further investigation beyond the scope of this review. However, better false negative rates reflect better read alignment by the aligner.In contrast to shallow depth whole genome sequencing, where the false negative mutations can be affected by various GATK parameters, mapping quality threshold is the main factor impacting the results in Oliver’s paper.In order to examine the effect of re-parameterization of GATK on the number of variants, we used the read filter (-rf) option of GATK and reassigned mapping quality with the ReassignMappingQuality -DMQ 60 (unsupported) option. As we expected, we could reduce the number of false negatives from 40 to 22 and recovered the variants missing due to low mapping quality. However, this recovery comes at the cost of increasing the false positives from 66 to 304. This observation is in line with that of Pertea and Salzberg’s that “in our experience we can easily increase the number of SNPs by a factor of 5-fold simply by varying its parameters, REGARDLESS of the alignments provided at the front end”.We also note here that most of the improvement in the false negative rates going from single-end to paired-end analysis are related to improved mapping quality since read pairing improves the specificity of read mapping. Consequently, for a paired-end dataset re-parameterization of GATK can mostly impact the false positive rates without much change in false negatives.This evidence presented here is to the contrary of the main concern of Pertea and Salzberg that “our fundamental concern that, despite its claims, it doesn’t evaluate aligners, but their capacity to work with the GATK pipeline.” In fact this evidence shows that the false negatives are mostly affected by the ability of the aligners to produce (1) coverage around the mutation, (2) high mapping quality, and (3) correct alignment.While it is true that false positive rate can be significantly impacted by GATK parameters, the main concern of genetic screening is to reduce false negative rates and to keep false positives within a reasonably low level. Based on the evidence presented here, false negative rates can only be improved by GATK re-parameterization at the cost of excessive increase in false positive rates compared to the default settings used in Oliver’s paper. Mapping quality threshold is the main influencer of the single-end sequencing results but it has a standard definition independent of the mapping software. For this reason, it does not affect different aligners differently. Heterozygous mutation rates would be significantly impacted by GATK parameters, but it was not a subject of Oliver’s study. Consequently, re-parameterization of GATK for every aligner would make the results less and not more comparable.Pertea and Salzberg argue that „All the article really shows is how a particular program, GATK, functions in concert with different aligners.

In contrast to other comparative studies on mapping and alignment where the emphasis is made on re-mapping accuracy of the reads, this study gives a meaningful metric for those who want to use NGS for BRCA screening. This paper advances our understanding of NGS analysis and serves patients who are tested for BRCA mutations.In the interest of those labs defying Myriad’s BRCA patent and apply NGS for the benefit of patients, I ask Pertea and Salzberg to reconsider their rejection of the paper and give clear instructions to the author what reasonable changes he has to make in order for the paper to be accepted to advance science for the benefit of patients In this review I make arguments based on some computational evidence in support of Oliver’s experimental design and make some observations on the reviews made by Pertea and Salzberg. I declare conflict of interest since I am involved with one of the alignment software reviewed in Oliver’s paper. I note that Pertea and Salzberg chose not to declare conflict of interest in a similar position.Before going into details, I would like to note that both Oliver in this F1000 article and Pertea and Salzberg in their Do-It-Yourself Genetic Testing paper in Genome Biology make important contribution to advance the use of next generation sequencing for BRCA analysis for the benefit of patients. However, they are approaching the same subject from a different perspective. These differences in perspective are reflected in the review of Pertea and Salzberg.Oliver’s experimental design reflects the fact that he carried out this study in a company considering mutational analysis based on next generation sequencing and that in practice such tests use deep targeted sequencing approaches and not whole genome analysis. Some of the arguments made by Pertea and Salzberg reflect experiences with relatively low depth whole genome or whole exome studies, but as I present some evidence here, deep targeted sequencing needs different considerations.In addition to considering the type of experiment, Oliver considered the mutational profile of the target gene. In some populations one third of inherited breast cancer cases are linked to significant insertions or deletions. The inability of the NGS pipeline to detect long indels would mean that the method fails to screen the third of the target population. Oliver carefully considered variants relevant from this screening perspective. When a patient is diagnosed with deleterious BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations they have to make life-changing decisions that could be as severe as electing for preventive mastectomy or ovariectomy. Consequently, in BRCA screening or any other genetic tests, one cannot afford to have false negative mutations and thus false negatives are the critical evaluation criteria.In the diagnostic analysis of BRCA, all variants are followed up by visual inspection of the underlying data and if necessary they are confirmed by Sanger sequencing. False positives are relevant to the extent they generate wasted effort of following them up. When the false positive rate is high, the wasted effort can offset the economic benefits of using NGS in the first place.Oliver’s experiment simulated deep, PCR primer-based, targeted sequencing data. The Haloplex and the Ampliseq kits are commercially available for BRCA analysis and are examples of experiments producing such datasets. Oliver considered homozygous mutations since only these are relevant from a genetic screening perspective.A key argument made by Pertea and Salzberg is that GATK parameterization strongly influences the results and the false variants rate does not reflect the performance of the alignment algorithms. While this argument is correct for whole genome and even whole exome studies considering both homozygous and heterozygous variants, Oliver simulated deep targeted sequencing and examined homozygous mutations only. Restricting the analysis to homozygous mutations removes significant dependence of the results on GATK parameters. GATK parameterization impacts the results of deep, targeted sequencing experiments differently from that of whole genome sequencing. In order to examine the effect of variant calling parameterization as well as the reasons for false negatives, my colleague Tibor Nagy repeated the experiments in Oliver’s paper using the Bowtie2/GATK pipeline. We examined the false negatives, as well as the dependence of the false positive rates on the GATK parameterization.We have visually inspected the read alignment in the region of all 40 false negative variants produced by the single-end Bowtie2/GATK pipeline. The false negatives can be explained by no coverage for 11 mutations, by low mapping quality for 18 mutations, and by alignment error for 11 mutations. GATK parameterization will only affect one of these categories:(1) The missing variants due to no-coverage will not be found by any parameterization of GATK.(2) Low mapping quality reads supporting missing variants can be recovered by lowering the corresponding threshold in GATK.(3) The alignment error is the most complex category and warrants further investigation beyond the scope of this review. However, better false negative rates reflect better read alignment by the aligner.In contrast to shallow depth whole genome sequencing, where the false negative mutations can be affected by various GATK parameters, mapping quality threshold is the main factor impacting the results in Oliver’s paper.In order to examine the effect of re-parameterization of GATK on the number of variants, we used the read filter (-rf) option of GATK and reassigned mapping quality with the ReassignMappingQuality -DMQ 60 (unsupported) option. As we expected, we could reduce the number of false negatives from 40 to 22 and recovered the variants missing due to low mapping quality. However, this recovery comes at the cost of increasing the false positives from 66 to 304. This observation is in line with that of Pertea and Salzberg’s that “in our experience we can easily increase the number of SNPs by a factor of 5-fold simply by varying its parameters, REGARDLESS of the alignments provided at the front end”.We also note here that most of the improvement in the false negative rates going from single-end to paired-end analysis are related to improved mapping quality since read pairing improves the specificity of read mapping. Consequently, for a paired-end dataset re-parameterization of GATK can mostly impact the false positive rates without much change in false negatives.This evidence presented here is to the contrary of the main concern of Pertea and Salzberg that “our fundamental concern that, despite its claims, it doesn’t evaluate aligners, but their capacity to work with the GATK pipeline.” In fact this evidence shows that the false negatives are mostly affected by the ability of the aligners to produce (1) coverage around the mutation, (2) high mapping quality, and (3) correct alignment.While it is true that false positive rate can be significantly impacted by GATK parameters, the main concern of genetic screening is to reduce false negative rates and to keep false positives within a reasonably low level. Based on the evidence presented here, false negative rates can only be improved by GATK re-parameterization at the cost of excessive increase in false positive rates compared to the default settings used in Oliver’s paper. Mapping quality threshold is the main influencer of the single-end sequencing results but it has a standard definition independent of the mapping software. For this reason, it does not affect different aligners differently. Heterozygous mutation rates would be significantly impacted by GATK parameters, but it was not a subject of Oliver’s study. Consequently, re-parameterization of GATK for every aligner would make the results less and not more comparable.Pertea and Salzberg argue that „All the article really shows is how a particular program, GATK, functions in concert with different aligners. GATK has been fine-tuned to use BWA, as its own developers acknowledge.” The actual findings of Oliver’s paper are contrary to this argument since BWA is the second worst performer in false negative rate in single-end mode. If fine-tuning the GATK parameters to the particular aligner impacted the results more than the quality of read alignment then BWA/GATK would outperform other pipelines.In my opinion Oliver’s paper can benefit from the following improvements and revisions:(1) Better explaining the implicit assumptions behind the design of the experiment(2) Emphasizing more the importance of false negative variants from a diagnostic perspective(3) Emphasizing that only the false negative rates are comparable across pipelines and that the actual values would depend on the mapping quality threshold(4) Showing that the false positive rate is sensitive to the parameterization of the GATK and should only be compared in order of magnitude across pipelines(5) Removing ppv values since those can be misleadingWith these improvements this article fills a gap.

IntroductionThe proprotein convertases (PCs) belong to a family of endoproteinases that cleave proproteins specifically at basic residue cleavage sites3. The first mammalian member of this group, furin, was identified by sequence homology4,5 to the yeast prohormone convertase, Kex2, which was the first eukaryotic enzyme to be described as a prohormone convertase6,7. Both Kex2 and furin are transmembrane proteins5,7–9. Other mammalian enzymes, homologous to furin were subsequently cloned, of which PC1 (also described as PC3 or SPC3) and PC2 were found to be exclusively expressed in (neuro)endocrine tissue10–14, suggesting their function to be specific for the maturation of peptide hormones and neuropeptides. Both enzymes do not contain classical amino acid sequences that would predict them to have a transmembrane domain.PC1 is expressed as a pre-pro-protein of ~92 kDa in mass. After removal of the signal peptide, the pro-protein undergoes autocatalytic conversion in the ER to an 87 kDa form15–18. This form of PC1 can subsequently be converted to a 64–66 kDa form19,20 which is the predominant form found in dense-core granules of the bovine pituitary21. The conversion from 87 kDa to 64 kDa is the result of the removal of the carboxyl terminus in a late compartment of the secretory pathway22. We and others have investigated the function of the C-terminus of PC1, since it does not appear to be involved in catalysis per se and is distinct from the P-domain of PC1 which is involved in the stability and pH and calcium dependence of PC1 activity23. Initial studies revealed that the C-terminus of PC1 is involved in the efficient trafficking of PC1 to the regulated secretory pathway (RSP)24–26, giving rise to the identification of three alpha-helical amphipathic sequences important in this function. Recent studies by Dikeakos et al.27,28, have characterized by NMR the extreme C-terminal sequence and identified important residues within the sequence involved in binding to membrane patches which were important for sorting.Previously, we showed by immuno-labeling and classical extraction studies, that in intact purified bovine chromaffin granules, PC1 behaved in part like a transmembrane protein1. We identified, immunologically and functionally, the putative transmembrane (TM) sequence (aa617–638), and showed that when fused with the soluble extracellular domain of the IL2 receptor alpha-subunit (Tac), it could direct this protein to secretory granules of the RSP1. Indeed, deletion studies identified this sequence as necessary for PC1 sorting to the RSP29. We speculated about how PC1 might assume a TM orientation and the consequences of having a cytosolic domain. However, Stettler et al. provided evidence that transfected PC1 is not synthesized as a TM protein in COS1 cells30. In our current study we address in a model endocrine cell line, AtT20 cells, which expresses PC1 endogenously, whether PC1 has properties consistent with that of a TM protein.","29 Aug 2012","Approved with Reservations","Regina Kuliawat, Department of Developmental & Molecular Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, USA","Reader Comment 20 Aug 2012"," Prohormone convertases (PCs) are clearly a critical component for the normal function of secretory granules and the mechanism by which PCs are efficiently targeted to the correct compartment needs to be well understood.The carboxy (C) terminus of PC1/3 is important for efficient trafficking to granules and interaction of the C-terminal sequence with membranes appears to be important for sorting. In neuroendocrine cells, processing of the 87 kDa ER to the 64-66 kDa form of PC1/3 occurs in a late compartment of the secretory pathway and involves the removal of the C terminus.  Based on the observations that in chromaffin granules PC1/3 may adopt a transmembrane orientation whereas in non-endocrine COS-1 cells, ER localized PC1/3 did not behave as a membrane spanning protein, Cawley and colleagues generated an antibody specific to the C terminus. In this report, the authors use biochemical and imaging approaches to characterize the behavior of the C terminus of PC1/3 in both endocrine (AtT20) and non-endocrine (COS7) cell lines to determine if the presence of the regulated secretory pathway influences the topology of PC1/3.Figure 1. AtT20 cells were lysed by freeze thawing and upon centrifugation and Western blot detection using the N-terminus directed antibody, proportionately more of the 87 kDa form is recovered in the membrane associated pellet. Alkaline carbonate extraction of the pellet fraction retrieves predominantly the proform. Overall, comparison of carbonate extraction profiles of PC1/3 to bone fide membrane or cytosolic proteins suggests that the unprocessed form of PC1/3 exhibits properties resembling those of a membrane protein.Figure 2. To examine the relationship between PC1/3 maturation and epitope recognition by the N-and C-directed antibodies, radiolabeled PC1/3 was evaluated. Prolonged labeling of cells is expected to load the more slowly turning over pools with radioactive PC1/3. Thus, 24 h metabolically labeled cells should have accumulated both the 87kDa and the processed 64 kDa forms preferentially within late compartments of the secretory pathway. The immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that both antibodies are capable of detecting PC1/3 but why, using the same cell lysate do the N-term and C-term antibodies differ so substantially in their recovery of the 87 kDa? In addition, PC1/3 does not have the traditional transmembrane segment and is thought to fully translocate into the ER lumen. Thus, a more careful pulse-chase analysis including sequential immunoprecipitations would have improved on the existing antibody characterization.Generally speaking, antibodies that recognize only denatured epitopes do not work well for immunofluorescence. Since the epitope recognition by the antibody is important for the analysis, the authors should provide an explanation why the rather elaborate heating/solubilization protocol was required to prepare the cell lysates for immunoprecipitation. Nevertheless, The C-and N-terminus directed antibodies show a distinct pattern of recognition in metabolically labeled cells, with C-term antibody capturing the immature forms of PC1/3.Figures 3-5. For immunocytochemical analysis, treatment with Triton permeabilizes plasma membrane as well as intracellular membranes and allows antibodies to bind to epitopes oriented towards both cytosol and lumen. Tested in this section of the report is the underlying assumption that paraformaldehyde fixation permeabilizes the plasma membrane leaving intracellular membranes intact and antibodies cannot gain access to the lumen of organelles. Antibodies raised against the N-terminal domain of PC1/3 (oriented towards the lumen) is expected to immunostain PC1/3 only in cells treated with Triton X-100, whereas antibodies raised against the C-terminal domain (if oriented towards cytoplasm) will stain PC1/3 in the presence or absence of Triton X-100. Indeed, PFA fixation is sufficient for access by the C-terminal PC1/3 antibody as well as the antibodies to cytosolic proteins, whereas lumenal proteins cannot be detected–antibody to N terminus of PC1/3 falls into this latter category.  The reduced but similar pattern of C-PC1/3 antibody staining obtained in the absence or presence of detergent permeabilization is taken as evidence for the membrane spanning topology of PC1/3.To strengthen the conclusion and to exclude the possibility that some of the staining reflects damaged, hence leaky or ruptured organelles, controls to demonstrate organelle integrity are needed. Co-localization experiments shown in Figure 5, should have also characterized the appropriate lumenal markers. Protease protection is an additional method for assaying cytosolic protein domains and a fluorescence-based technique involving protease protection (Lorenz H, Hailey DW, & Lippincott-Schwartz J, 2008) would have been an additional test to use in support of PC1/3 trans-membrane orientation.Figure 6. Finally, in COS7 cells, the C terminus of PC1/3, clearly detectable in perinuclear regions when detergent is present, is not available to antibody binding in the absence of detergent. This is in agreement with the report from Stettler and colleagues  (although the reference appears to be missing) and raises the intriguing possibility that ‘helper’ proteins, specific to cells with a regulated secretory pathway, may potentiate the insertion into membranes. Here as well, the work would have benefited from a more extensive characterization of ER localized PC1/3. I have read this submission. I believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard, however I have significant reservations, as outlined above.

Continue reading The data in the present paper do not provide a convincing case that PC1/PC3 is a transmembrane protein, especially in light of the published results from other laboratories that find PC1/PC3 is a peripheral membrane protein, not a transmembrane protein. The immunostaining results shown in the present study do not provide compelling evidence that overturns the results from other labs. Furthermore, PC1/PC3 lacks a predicted transmembrane domain (but does have an amphipathic sequence proposed to bind the protein as a peripheral membrane protein). To claim that the protein is a transmembrane protein, and overturn evidence from other labs (as well as the prediction from the sequence) requires more proof than shown in this paper. In addition, the authors make a point in the discussion that PC2 and CPE are both transmembrane proteins, but do not mention that these claims are also highly controversial. It would have been appropriate for the authors to point out the controversy with CPE and PC2 in the Discussion, and not give the false impression that these are well accepted to be integral membrane proteins. Specifically, the evidence that CPE is a peripheral membrane protein and not an integral transmembrane protein is summarized as follows:1) There is no sequence within CPE that fits with the standard transmembrane-spanning domain sequence requirements. Only the extreme N-terminal domain has a region long enough to be a transmembrane domain, but this region is the signal peptide. Signal prediction programs (SignalP) give a high score. More importantly, N-terminal sequencing shows the correct Nterm after signal peptide removal.2) The difference between membrane and soluble forms of CPE is at the C-terminal region, based on the results with antibodies raised against the N- and C-terminal regions. Antibodies to the N-term recognize both soluble and membrane-bound forms, while those to the extreme C-term recognize only the membrane-bound forms (Fricker et al. (1990); Fricker and Devi (1993)). Further analysis of the forms purified from soluble and membrane fractions showed heterogeneity at both the N-term and C-term ends, but only the longer C-term ends correlated with membrane binding (Fricker and Devi, In: Innovations in Proteases and Their Inhibitors, F.X.Aviles Ed, Publisher Walter de Gruyter, 1993).3) Modeling of the C-term region of CPE predicts an amphipathic alpha helix, containing 8-10 hydrophobic groups on one side of the helix and a E-K-E bridge on the other side.  (Fricker et al. (1990)). There is no prediction for a transmembrane-spanning hydrophobic domain.4) Synthetic peptides corresponding to the C-term of CPE that include the predicted amphipathic helix form a helix (based on circular dichroism) and bind to membranes. (Fricker et al. (1990)). This supports a peripheral type of membrane attachment, not a transmembrane-spanning attachment.5) The membrane binding of CPE is pH dependent, with the vast majority extracted by neutral pH (7.5). Carbonate extraction strips CPE off the membrane. Carbonate-resistant membrane binding is the criterion for an intrinsic membrane protein. The fact that even neutral pH pulls off membrane-bound CPE clearly shows that it is a peripheral membrane protein and not a transmembrane-spanning integral membrane protein. (Fricker et al. (1990)).6) The synthetic peptides corresponding to the Cterm of CPE show a pH-dependent binding to membranes that is very similar to the pH dependence of CPE binding to membranes. (Fricker et al. (1990)).7) Both the membrane form of CPE and the synthetic peptides partition into the detergent Triton X114 at acidic pH, but not much at pH values of 7-9. (Fricker et al. (1990)).8) When the C-terminal 51 residues of CPE were attached to Albumin and the protein expressed in AtT20 cells, the albumin containing the CPE C-term immunoreactive peptide was mostly found in the membrane fractions when extracted at pH 5.5. (Mitra, Song, Fricker, JBC, 1994). This further supports the idea that the C-term region of CPE is responsible for membrane binding. 9) CPE with the intact Cterm (based on immunoreactivity with an antiserum raised against the C-term 9 residues) is secreted from AtT-20 cells into the media. (Mitra, Song, Fricker,(1994)).10) Albumin with the C-term of CPE (which is membrane bound at pH 5.5 - see point #8) is also secreted from AtT-20 cells with the C-term intact. (Mitra, Song, Fricker,(1994)). In summary, it is hard to explain how an integral transmembrane protein is bound to membranes at pH 5 but released at pH 7-8 and secreted from cells with the C-term intact. The most likely explanation is that CPE is a peripheral membrane protein. Cawley et al should not have stated this controversial point as a fact. There is no precedent for PC1/PC3 to be a transmembrane protein based on CPE. The data in the present paper do not provide a convincing case that PC1/PC3 is a transmembrane protein, especially in light of the published results from other laboratories that find PC1/PC3 is a peripheral membrane protein, not a transmembrane protein.

Recent optogenetic technologies, which allow neurons to respond to specific wavelengths of light with action potential output, are now providing a significant advance in our ability to control the activity of select cell populations and neural circuits in behaving animals1. These tools allow for bidirectional control over the neuronal activity2. To date, the majority of optogenetic experiments have used transgenic, virally-mediated, or a combination of the two approaches in mice3–5. Here we use virally-mediated gene delivery of the light-responsive proteins ChR26 or halorhodopsin7 in Sprague-Dawley rat PFC PL pyramidal neurons. Expression of ChR2 and NpHR enables neurons to be depolarized and silenced by pulses of blue and green light, respectively. We tested how well PL pyramidal neurons expressing ChR2 followed pulses (10 ms) of blue light delivered at 20 Hz (fidelity). Given the potential importance of long duration light delivery for a variety of protocols we determined if stable responses could be elicited from individual neurons for at least 2 hrs. Lastly, we tested green light-induced silencing of spontaneously active NpHR expressing PL neurons to determine if network-driven action potential activity could be silenced continuously for 10 seconds, thus establishing the feasibility of long duration silencing for behavioral testing.","31 Jul 2012","Approved","Ege Kavalali, Department of Neuroscience, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, USA","Author Response 03 Aug 2012"," Overall, this is a well-executed study that fits the publication objectives of F1000Research.The authors report in vivo single unit recordings from cortical prelimbic pyramidal neurons expressing channelrhodopsin-2 or halorhodopsin. Although the basic premise of this article is not entirely novel and the authors refrain from arriving at any firm biological conclusions, the results raise some interesting issues. For instance, in Figure 1 and 2 channelrhodopsin-2 induced firing shows a rapid decrease in frequency (Figure 1b and 2c) which can elicit significant plasticity of the neurotransmitter release output of these neurons. Along the same lines in Figure 3, after 10 sec of green light exposure the firing frequency recovery shows significant rebound facilitation, which again could significantly impact neurotransmitter release output of these neurons. Therefore, in order to be able interpret the behavioral correlates of these activity patterns accurately, one would need to know the synaptic output properties of these neurons during and after optogenetic stimulation/silencing.

Continue reading We thank Dr. Eichenbaum for his helpful critique of our research article. One goal we had for this research article posted in the new F1000Research science publishing model was to quickly share some of our ongoing recording datasets in order to encourage collaboration with others in the field. Our goal is to ultimately publish these datasets together with more complete analysis and conclusion and other work from our lab or new collaborators. Because we intend on publishing this data with more data and more complete analysis and conclusions we kept the analysis and conclusions to a minimum so as not to violate subsequent journal publishing policies regarding prior publication.The question of novelty:As was pointed out this is not the first demonstration of light-evoked activation or silencing of neural activity, so in that regard we have only successfully replicated others. However, we presented several novel findings that have not yet been reported in the literature. For example, we present novel data showing that channelrhodopsin continues to function even after 2 hrs of recording of an individual virally infected neuron. We demonstrated that CaMKII expressing (light responsive) pyramidal neurons can be classified into phasic and nonphasic based on the periodicity revealed in the autocorrelation histogram of their firing pattern and this too is novel. Overall, we described a novel protocol demonstrating light activation across a range of frequencies that may be relevant for behavioral procedures. Anyone interested in the light-evoked neural response parameters for behavioral testing can be assured that under the conditions we described high fidelity light responsiveness will be maintained. Despite these novel findings, novelty is not a criteria for the F1000Research publishing model. In fact, replication is encouraged (see http://f1000research.com/about/).Regarding control recordings using light alone:It was suggested that we try recording from uninfected neurons to see if light alone might drive action potential firing. We have done this several times and in the article we stated the following, “Control recordings using blue and green light (light intensities of 250 mW/mm2) did not alter spontaneous firing rates in PL neurons that did not express either ChR2 or NpHR as inferred from the lack of time-locked light responses (data not shown), which suggests no unexpected off-target effects of light alone on neuronal activity.” This data will be provided in future publications along with more analysis and conclusions.Regarding a more comprehensive discussion of related work and comparisons of rebound responses:We certainly intend on following this advice in future journal submissions. For this research article we do not have enough data yet to make any conclusions about whether the rebound phenomenon following halorhodopsin that has been reported in vitro actually extends to the in vivo milieu. Our data is suggestive and as we stated in the article more data is needed and these experiments are ongoing.Low baseline firing:The baseline firing is typical for in vivo prefrontal cortical pyramidal neuron spontaneous firing under anesthetized conditions (e.g. Laviolette and Grace, 2006). The light evoked firing was done in neurons that were selected for their sparse firing rate in order to better show the ability of light-activated channelrhodopsin to initiate action potential activity. For silencing, we explicitly chose neurons with spontaneous activity so that we could observe the silencing effect of halorhodopsin.We are excited to contribute the the new model of science publishing F1000Research has offered and we appreciate the thoughtful comments from Dr. Eichenbaum that will improve our subsequent publication. We also welcome new collaborators resulting from this research article! We thank Dr. Eichenbaum for his helpful critique of our research article. One goal we had for this research article posted in the new F1000Research science publishing model was to quickly share some of our ongoing recording datasets in order to encourage collaboration with others in the field. Our goal is to ultimately publish these datasets together with more complete analysis and conclusion and other work from our lab or new collaborators. Because we intend on publishing this data with more data and more complete analysis and conclusions we kept the analysis and conclusions to a minimum so as not to violate subsequent journal publishing policies regarding prior publication.The question of novelty:As was pointed out this is not the first demonstration of light-evoked activation or silencing of neural activity, so in that regard we have only successfully replicated others. However, we presented several novel findings that have not yet been reported in the literature. For example, we present novel data showing that channelrhodopsin continues to function even after 2 hrs of recording of an individual virally infected neuron. We demonstrated that CaMKII expressing (light responsive) pyramidal neurons can be classified into phasic and nonphasic based on the periodicity revealed in the autocorrelation histogram of their firing pattern and this too is novel. Overall, we described a novel protocol demonstrating light activation across a range of frequencies that may be relevant for behavioral procedures. Anyone interested in the light-evoked neural response parameters for behavioral testing can be assured that under the conditions we described high fidelity light responsiveness will be maintained. Despite these novel findings, novelty is not a criteria for the F1000Research publishing model. In fact, replication is encouraged (see http://f1000research.com/about/).Regarding control recordings using light alone:It was suggested that we try recording from uninfected neurons to see if light alone might drive action potential firing. We have done this several times and in the article we stated the following, “Control recordings using blue and green light (light intensities of 250 mW/mm2) did not alter spontaneous firing rates in PL neurons that did not express either ChR2 or NpHR as inferred from the lack of time-locked light responses (data not shown), which suggests no unexpected off-target effects of light alone on neuronal activity.” This data will be provided in future publications along with more analysis and conclusions.Regarding a more comprehensive discussion of related work and comparisons of rebound responses:We certainly intend on following this advice in future journal submissions. For this research article we do not have enough data yet to make any conclusions about whether the rebound phenomenon following halorhodopsin that has been reported in vitro actually extends to the in vivo milieu. Our data is suggestive and as we stated in the article more data is needed and these experiments are ongoing.Low baseline firing:The baseline firing is typical for in vivo prefrontal cortical pyramidal neuron spontaneous firing under anesthetized conditions (e.g. Laviolette and Grace, 2006).

Rapamycin-sensitive orthologues of mTOR exist in eukaryotes from yeast to man and are required for growth and proliferation of perhaps all eukaryotic cells. As such, rapamycin has been classified as an anti-fungal agent and is clinically approved as an immunosuppressant and cancer therapy1–3. Well-characterized in vivo substrates of rapamycin-sensitive mTOR activity include the 70 kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K1) and the eukaryotic [translation] initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1). The mTOR-dependent phosphorylation site on S6K1, Thr389, is required for kinase activity, explaining rapamycin’s inhibition of S6K1 activity4. 4E-BP1, on the other hand, is subject to multisite phosphorylation culminating in the release of bound eIF4E, leading to an ambiguous understanding of which phosphorylation site(s) regulate(s) eIF4E binding5.Mammalian 4E-BP1 is subject to an ordered phosphorylation on at least 5 major amino acid residues in response to serum-stimulation, as has been demonstrated by two-dimensional (isoelectric focusing and SDS-PAGE) electrophoresis (2DE)6. This approach of separating post-translationally modified forms of a protein based on charge and apparent molecular weight has proved to be particularly useful when combined with phosphorylation-specific antibodies7. Due to amino acid sequence similarity, phospho-specific anti-Thr37/46 antibodies did not allow determination of whether the initial phosphorylation event is at Thr37 or Thr46 using this technique, although priming phosphorylation at both of these sites is thought to be required for subsequent phosphorylation at Thr70, followed by phosphorylation at an unidentified site, and finally at Ser656,8. Given their positions flanking the amino acids responsible for eIF4E binding (amino acid residues 53–59), it is conceivable that Thr46 and Ser65 are responsible for the phosphorylation-mediated modulation of eIF4E binding occurring in response to mTOR activity. Indeed, a significant body of work supports the role of phosphorylation at Thr46 in regulating eIF4E:4E-BP1 binding9–12. Detailed analyses have led, however, to conflicting results regarding the importance of Ser65 phosphorylation in preventing this protein:protein interaction6,11,13–15.While rapamycin is effective in blocking phosphorylation at Thr70 and Ser65, phospho-specific antibodies to Thr37/46 show that at least one of these sites is largely rapamycin-insensitive16,17. This residual rapamycin-insensitive phosphorylation is sensitive to serum starvation, amino acid withdrawal, and non-specific phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and PI3K-like kinase (PIKK) inhibitors16–19. Furthermore, the use of mTOR kinase domain inhibitors (Torin1 and PP242) in combination with mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2)-deficient cells, has allowed the determination that Thr37/46 phosphorylation represents a rapamycin-insensitive function of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1)20,21.In vivo studies addressing the relative importance of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation sites have been hampered by its ordered phosphorylation, wherein Thr-to-Ala mutation of Thr37 or Thr46 will block subsequent phosphorylation at Thr70 and Ser65. Mounting circumstantial evidence supports the notion that phosphorylation of Thr37/Thr46 alone is the key event regulating eIF4E:4E-BP1 binding in vivo. Intracellular co-localization of endogenous 4E-BP1 and eIF4E best correlates with dephosphorylation at Thr37/4619. 7-methyl-GTP (cap-column) pull down of eIF4E:4E-BP1 complexes is enhanced by mTOR kinase domain inhibitors more than it is by rapamycin21. Most importantly, however, mTOR active site inhibitors capable of blocking phosphorylation at Thr37/46 (and not rapamycin) induce 4E-BP-dependent phenotypes in cells22.This manuscript describes new data demonstrating that 4E-BP1 phosphorylation at the initial, mTORC1-dependent, rapamycin-insensitive phosphorylation site is alone in regulating eIF4E binding. Furthermore, this work suggests that Thr46, and not Thr37, is this key phosphorylation site. Given the recent push for pharmaceutical development of kinase inhibitors that block both the rapamycin-sensitive and rapamycin-insensitive activities of mTOR23, a thorough understanding of the importance of rapamycin-insensitive mTORC1 activity is crucial. This manuscript supports the idea that clinically used mTOR kinase domain inhibitors will reduce eIF4E availability much more profoundly than have clinically approved rapamycin analogs.","02 Aug 2012","Approved","Olaf Isken, Institute of Virology and Cell Biology, University of Lübeck, Germany","Reader Comment 20 Jul 2012"," This submission is quite nice for experts, but not particularly well-written for those outside of the field of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, who will have difficulty reading it ; hence my suggested clarifications below. The article is important as it demonstrates that the use of mTOR-kinase domain inhibitors would be more efficacious than the use of rapamycin analogs as therapeutics.The work clarifies that phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at Ser65 by mTOR is not required to inhibit 4E-BP1 binding to eIF4E and that rapamycin-insensitive mTOR-mediated phosphorylation at 4E-BP1 Thr46 is sufficient to inhibit 4E-BP1 binding to eIF4E. Phosphorylation at 4E-BP1 Thr37 is also shown to be rapamycin-insensitive. Notably, evidence that phosphorylation at Thr 37 or Thr 46 appears to be required for phosphorylation at Thr 70 and Ser 65 supported the notion that the earlier phosphorylation events were key to promoting translation.Improvement Suggestions:Page 2, first paragraph, last sentence. The meaning of “4E-BP-dependent phenotypes” is not particularly clear.Page 2, line four of Materials and Methods. Shouldn’t “32<U+2033> be superscript?Page 2, last paragraph. The statement “Here, six differentially phosphorylated forms (A-F) …” is confusing. Is form A really phosphorylated? Earlier in the manuscript, the authors mentioned 5 major phosphorylation sites.In Figure 1, the assay used in this Figure requires much better description in the text. Part A of the legend requires specification of the experimental approach. Also, the title of Figure 1 could be more useful if it were informative/conclusive rather than descriptive.Page 3, right column, second paragraph. The sentence “While endogenous… , suggesting that Thr46 phosphorylation is required for subsequent The37 phosphorylation under normal growth conditions.” is misleading since 4E-BP1 mutant (Thr46Ala) is clearly phosphorylated at Thr37 in Fig. 2A middle panel. With the data presented here the reader is left wondering whether the differences in detecting HA-4E-BP1 (T37A) or HA-4E-BP1 (T46A) might be simply due to different affinities of the (The37/46) antibody used.What is the difference between the middle and the lower panel? Are the antibodies used to probe the middle and the lower panel (e.g. phosho-HA-4E-BP1 (Thr37/46) vs. phosho-4E-BP1 (Thr37/46)) different or the same? When using cell lysates of stable cell lines and a phospho-4E-BP1 (Thr37/46) antibody, shouldn’t be HA 4E-BP1 wildtype and mutant forms be detectable in the lower panel as well?Page 3, last paragraph, line 8. “modulate” would be clearer if described as the specific modulations that occur – in the literature a state of 4E-BP1 hypophosphorylation. The author understands that the changes are complicated and clarified from these authors’ perspective in Figure 3 and in the Discussion. However, possibly, the reader could be better informed at this point of the manuscript.Page 4, second paragraph, right-hand column. Please clarify the effects and usefulness of etoposide and the meaning of VCP and, in the legend, VCP/Chk2.In Figure 2B, the authors should provide a control western blot of an unrelated protein which does not belong to the eIF4E-associated proteins under normal conditions to show the unspecific background of this assay.It is not clear to this reader why mono-phosphorylated 4E-BP1 (at position Thr70) is detectable in the non-Nocadazole treated cell samples in Fig. 2B (lane 3 and 5) when in Fig.3 they show that mono-phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at position Thr70 is triggered by a Nocodazol-induced block of Hela cells but not detectable under normal conditions.In Figure 3, why did the authors mix Control and Nocodazole-blocked Hela cell lysates instead of showing them side-by-side? Also, why are there additional spots in the interpretation panels for Phos-Thr70 and Phos-Thr37/46 that have no counterpart in the respective western blot panels? This figure is already difficult, so the authors should be careful with the overlays.In Figure 4, all results in this Figure are not adequately described. For example, the authors need to explain the analysis of ubiquitin and its significance to their studies.The sentence “ …rapamycin-insensitive phosphorylation site is alone in regulating eIF4E binding.” should read something like “ …rapamycin-insensitive phosphorylation site is alone responsible in regulating eIF4E binding”.

Individuals wishing to learn about their genomes today enjoy a range of options. DTC providers typically offer chip-based genotyping of genome-wide markers, currently in the range of hundreds of thousands to a million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). This current wealth of personal genomic data is likely to grow at an increasing pace as DNA sequencing become ubiquitous in personal genome testing. Genome sequencing allows elucidation of not just SNPs, but copy number variants (CNVs), insertions, inversions and many other genomic features currently underrepresented in personal genome analyses. Yet personal SNP data has proven to be a valuable resource for making personalized inferences about the risk of developing medical conditions, the probability of having certain phenotypic traits, and one’s likely ancestral origins1,2. Taking advantage of the growing body of statistical associations accumulated in the scientific literature, DTC providers have been able to offer personalized genomic ‘reports’ that present accessible scientific information of relevance to their customers’ observed genotypes. It is precisely in these genomic annotations where customers realize the value of their DTC product purchase.A feature of DTC genomic test interpretation is that, being a commercial product, genomic annotations and analysis tools are proprietary and not freely available to the research community. This has motivated the parallel development of public resources and low cost genotype analysis tools. SNPedia3 is a wiki-styled resource that collects and annotates SNPs from the scientific literature and provides tools with which to associate these annotations to those observed in DTC genomic tests. openSNP4 is a public resource that collects genotypes from people willing to share them, allows annotation of phenotypes, and the search of occurrences of a particular SNP in scientific publications using Mendeley5. Although all resources, public or commercial, are limited by the reliability of the data available for any given marker, public and low cost resources have the potential of engaging community wide efforts (‘crowd-sourcing’) to an extent to which closed commercial applications cannot.We decided to explore the extent to which phenotype inference and genotype analysis can be carried out solely using existing public or very low cost resources. This is motivated by our belief that no DTC company will ultimately be able to match the rapid pace of genomic data accumulation and annotation that the research community is producing. Apart from SNPedia or openSNP, a wiki-based model, perhaps integrated with existing genetics resources such as the Gene Wiki6 or Gene Wiki+7, may offer a good solution for rapid, accurate and comprehensive community annotation of personal genomic data.In this paper we carry out a systematic analysis of DTC genomic data from a family of five blood relatives using mostly public annotations and tools. We present a) our findings related to the quality of the data, b) a comparison of the similarity between members of the family and an undisclosed individual of a different ethnic background and c) phenotype inferences as described by SNPedia trait annotations. We also incorporate analysis of DTC exome sequence data to supplement the genotype findings of one individual. We thus offer a pioneering methodical study of a whole family analyzed using only DTC data. Since comparable data could, in principle, be bought by any individual, this study benchmarks the personal genomic analyses available to non-experts using open, web-based tools.","26 Jul 2012","Approved","Christian Gilissen, Department of Human Genetics, Radboud University, Nijmegen Medical Center, Netherlands",NA," This is a well written and interesting article that describes analyses on genome-wide genotyping information from a DTC company.Major concernsAlthough the analyses are carried out very well, the overall purpose and conclusion of the paper is rather mixed and somewhat unclear. The authors state that they “explore the extent to which phenotype inference and genotype analysis can be carried out solely using existing public or very low cost resources.” or as in the abstract “providing an evaluation of the current potential of public available analysis tools for personal genomics”.The discussion section focuses very much on the results of the different analyses, whereas that is (according to the purpose of the paper) not that relevant. Rather in that context it would be more interesting to speculate on other aspects (for example, how easy it is for a typical DTC customer to apply the publicly available tools, or how easy it is to (correctly) interpret the outcome of such tools) and to provide a real conclusion on “the extent to which phenotype inference and genotype analysis can be carried out solely using existing public or very low cost resources.”It is not clear whether the tools that were investigated compromise all public domain tools for these kinds of analyses. If the authors do not investigate all available tools, the authors should motivate their choice for the described toolsGiven the purpose of the paper, a table with the available tools and their “potential” would be very useful.Minor concernsThe fact that “Son” was done with a V2 assay complicates all comparisons in the paper. It seems to paper would be a lot more straightforward if the authors used a V3 assay for the son as well.Page 7, “Exome data summary statistics”, authors mention that the numbers they find are what is to be expected.

Anal sex has also been repeatedly associated with HIV infection in heterosexual Africans10–15, with some exceptions16,17. Knowledge of blood-borne HIV risks varies markedly across the region, with awareness much higher in West, central and East Africa than in southern Africa18. This geographic variation in knowledge corresponds closely to differences in HIV prevalence, such that countries in which many people know about blood-borne risks have much lower HIV prevalence than countries in which few know about these risks. Although HIV education campaigns in West, central and East Africa have included a focus on blood-borne risks, campaigns in Southern Africa have not, likely leading to deficits in Southern Africans’ knowledge. At the individual level, persons who know about blood-borne risks are modestly less likely to be HIV-infected than those who are not aware of such risks, independent of demographics and sexual behaviors18.In contrast, belief in condom use as a strategy for avoiding HIV infection is positively associated with HIV infection at both the individual and national levels in sub-Saharan Africa18. That is, those who believe condoms are an effective strategy for preventing HIV transmission are more likely to be HIV-infected than those who do not believe condom use protects against HIV, independent of demographics and sexual behaviors.Although long assumed to be rare, anal sex is not uncommon in sub-Saharan Africa, as modest to large proportions of heterosexual men and women report engaging in it10–15,19–27. Research based on nonprobability samples suggests that many Africans are unaware that anal sex is a significant risk for HIV transmission. While 87% of young adult Nigerians in one study knew anal sex is an HIV risk28, only 54% of men in Cape Town, South Africa in 199919 and 29% of adolescents in a Western Cape (South Africa) township with very high HIV prevalence shared that perception26. Some South African women in a qualitative study explained the lack of risk involved with anal sex29. Moreover, Kenyan prostitutes viewed vaginal sex as equally or more risky than anal sex21. Throughout the last 13 years, researchers have noted that HIV education campaigns targeting heterosexuals in sub-Saharan Africa lack warnings about the risk of anal sex10,15,19,23,24,27,30.In this paper, I report on the relationship between knowledge of HIV transmission routes and prevalent HIV infection in Mozambique, a country with high HIV prevalence not included in prior analyses. I analyzed data from the 2009 Mozamibique AIDS Indicator Survey (AIS), a special version of the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) conducted in poor countries. The 2009 Mozambique AIS differs from prior DHS with respect to how knowledge of HIV transmission risks was measured. In the 2009 Mozambique AIS respondents were asked directly about several specific blood-borne and sexual transmission routes. The 2009 Mozambique AIS also involved HIV testing of children, enabling examination of the association between mothers’ knowledge of blood-borne HIV transmission routes and HIV infection in their children.","02 Aug 2012","Approved","Carlos Morel, FIOCRUZ/CDTS, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Ministry of Health, Brazil","Author Response 02 Aug 2012"," This is an interesting article.

Merkel, are mostly located in the basal layer of the epidermis in distinct areas of hairy mammalian skin1. Merkel cells have also been shown in vertebrates and cyclostomes2 and can be widely found in hairy skin, the eccrine glandular ridges of the glabrous skin (palms and soles), ectoderm-derived mucosal tissues (palatine mucosa), and whisker pads or taste buds3,4. Merkel cells are generally classified into two distinct subpopulations based on whether or not they are associated with nerves. Those that are associated with nerves are referred to as the Merkel cell-nerve complexes and have mechanoreceptive and chemo-sensitive functions. Those that do not associate with nerves possess endocrine functions4–6. Recent studies have shown that Merkel cells are important in light-touch responses and can work as neurotransmitters, it is suggested that Merkel cells are essential for the perception of space experienced by individuals7.However, Merkel cells have, thus far, not been described on the ocular surface. In this study, we investigated the distribution and ultrastructure of Merkel cells on the ocular surface and revealed a morphological basis for further study of the function of Merkel cells on the ocular surface.","07 Mar 2014","Not Approved","Ingrid Moll, Department for Dermatology and Venerology, University Medical Center Eppendorf, Germany",NA," This paper deals with Merkel-like cells in the murine conjunctival stroma, claimed to be identified by immunofluorescence microscopy, incorporating TM1-43 dye and by electron microscopy.

Mycobacteriophages infect a number of bacterial hosts from the genus Mycobacterium, and they are broadly classified into Siphoviridae and Myoviridae. Mycobacteriophages are present in both land and aquatic environments and play a large ecological role in the turnover and evolution of bacteria (Bohannan & Lenski, 2000, Chibani-Chennoufi et al., 2004, Hendrix, 2002). The recent rise of antimicrobial-resistant pathogenic bacteria has renewed interest in mycobacteriophages and the potential for phage therapy of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections. Although in vivo experiments have not yet yielded promising clinical results, mycobacteriophages are still powerful diagnostic tools for the investigation of mycobacterial pathogenesis (Danelishvili, 2006, Hatfull, 2014, McNerney, 1999).The genomic sequences of mycobacteriophages are mosaic and diverse. As of April 2014, 663 distinct mycobacteriophage genomes were available on the database PhagesDB.org; most were isolated on Mycobacterium smegmatis MC2155. Global Guanine + Cytosine (GC) content ranges from 50.3% to 70% (mean of 63.9%), and genome lengths range from 41kb to 165kb (mean of 67kb). In total, more than 50,000 distinct genes are found within the population. The majority of these genes are of unknown function and do not have homologs in other types of phages or bacteria (Hatfull et al., 2010). However, many genes are shared between closely related mycobacteriophages. Similar genes have been grouped into almost 4,000 phamilies (or phams, a play on gene families) based on shared amino acid sequence. Phams have been used to investigate horizontal gene transfer within the mycobacteriophage population and to create phylogenetic trees.Despite the high levels of diversity, mycobacteriophages can be grouped into distinct clusters based on their morphologic and genetic features. Some clusters are large and further divided into subclusters (cluster A, for example, with 11 subclusters and 246 members), while other are small and undivided (cluster S with two members and no subclusters). Some phages have no nearest neighbor to establish a cluster and are classified as singletons. Clusters are defined using four methods: dot-plot comparisons, pairwise average nucleotide identities, pairwise genome map comparisons and gene content analysis (Hatfull et al., 2010). However, it should be noted that the clustering scheme proposed for mycobacteriophages mainly serves to identify similarities in genome architecture. This clustering scheme, and our proposed methods of grouping based on tetranucleotide usage described below, are not true taxonomic representations of the mycobacteriophage population. Extensive horizontal gene transfer prevents accurate reconstruction of evolutionary history from purely phylogenetic information (Lawrence et al., 2002).Methods traditionally used to analyze mycobacteriophage genomes require sequence alignment or genome annotation. These analytical tasks can be effective, but they are not without drawbacks. Alignment-based methods can be biased by the choice of score parameters (Frith et al., 2010), and genome annotation may require significant manual input, including by-hand verification of automated gene calls before a mycobacteriophage genome is submitted to GenBank. It is especially difficult to build multiple-sequence alignment based phylogenetic trees from mycobacteriophage genomes because phages lack a common genetic element, such as 16S rRNA in bacteria (Doolittle, 1999). Alignment-free methods avoid many of the disadvantages associated with alignment-based inference. These methods typically use statistics based on the oligonucleotide composition of a sequence and are completely independent of alignment or annotation. Several methods have been developed for different applications; most are covered in the excellent review by Vinga (2007). Alignment-free methods are also less computationally intensive than multiple sequence alignment. While the complexity of sequence alignment algorithms scales at least as fast as the square of the number of sequences (at least O(n2) complexity), alignment free methods typically fall below O(n2) (Chan & Ragan, 2013).Even so, there are drawbacks to alignment-free methods for analyzing genomes, mostly related to the interpretation of statistics in an evolutionary context. It can be difficult to understand how oligonucleotide frequencies are modified in a population over time when selection usually takes place at the level of genes. Oligonucleotide frequencies can also be subject to convergent evolution: if two distantly related phages slowly converge to similar usage frequencies, these methods can give a false indication of common ancestry (Pride et al., 2003).Alignment-free methods have been used to study phage and bacterial genomes in a variety of contexts. For example, Pride et al. (2006) found tetranucleotide usage to carry a strong phylogenetic signal in bacteriophages and showed that tetranucleotide composition was similar among phages with common hosts. More recently, Ogilvie et al. (2013) surveyed metagenomic sequencing datasets using a tetranucleotide usage-based method and discovered several novel Bacteroidales-like phages which could not be identified with alignment-based methods. Oligonucleotide composition vectors have also been proposed as a method to root viral phylogenies (Simmons, 2008).Statistics based on nucleotide composition in a sliding window can theoretically be used to uncover horizontal gene transfer (HGT), based on the assumption that genomes have self-similar nucleotide composition and outlier regions could represent recent horizontal transfer events (Lawrence & Ochman, 1997). Guanine + Cytosine (GC) content in a sliding window was first used to look for pathogenicity islands within a genome (Hacker & Kaper, 2000). More recent methods have used nucleotide composition and Naïve Bayesian classifiers (Sandberg et al., 2001) or hidden Markov models (Waack et al., 2006). However, if horizontally transferred segments change in oligonucleotide composition to be more similar to the resident genome, a process known as amelioration, it can obscure truly horizontally transferred segments (Koski et al., 2001).The number of sequenced mycobacteriophages has grown immensely in the past few years thanks to the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) Science Education Alliance Phage Hunters Advancing Genomics and Evolutionary Science (SEA-PHAGES) course (Jordan et al., 2014). This program allows first year undergraduate students to isolate and characterize novel mycobacteriophages from the environment. It has also provided excellent opportunities for collaborative projects between undergraduates, resulting in the work presented here.As the number of sequenced mycobacteriophages continues to increase, researchers need new methods to quickly make comparisons at many scales. Alignment-free methods are one possibility: they are independent of sequence alignment or genome annotation, less computationally complex than alignment-based methods and applicable to genomes without a common subsequence. We investigated tetranucleotide usage in mycobacteriophage genomes as an alignment-free alternative to traditional methods for genome comparison. Our findings support what is known about mycobacteriophage biology: phages form identifiable groups and subgroups, known as clusters, but have extensive differences between clusters. Tetranucleotide usage also highlights outliers in the population and can describe unique genomic features. All of the analyses here can be done in minutes on a personal laptop. Tetranucleotide usage is a powerful tool to quickly investigate features of the growing mycobacteriophage population.","10 Mar 2015","Not Approved","Oliver Bonham-Carter, College of Information Science & Technology, School of Interdisciplinary Informatics, University of Nebraska, NE, USA","Author Response 30 Oct 2015"," The article is nicely written but sadly, there are elements of discussion which are absent from the paper. If added, the paper's research on mycobacteriophages using alignment-free analysis would have much more support.The choice of TUD's as statistics for the alignment-free analysis is not fully explained /justified, nor is there much discussion about what algorithm or method is being employed by the analysis tools of the paper. Are TUD's frequencies? How do these software tools work? An simple example of how to calculate a TUD and apply it to a method is necessary to completely understand what they are and to see how they are different from any other motif frequency calculation applied to some other method. The assumptions of the methods are not discussed. Many methods from information theory, statistics and other kinds of mathematics require that the input data meets specific requirements (is normal, has a certain distribution, is a frequency, etc.). From the discussion in this paper, the function of analysis tool (the exact algorithm or method) is never clear and so we cannot be sure that the calculations from this work, as applied to these tools, is appropriate. For instance, many tools in information theory require that frequencies be used for their analysis. These frequencies must pass basic rules to be called as such (i.e., found on the scale of 0 to 1, all frequencies must sum to 1, 0 = false, 1 = true). This discussion is not mentioned and if it were, then the choice to used TUDs could be easily integrated into this discussion. The manuscript mentioned that k-mers in the range of two to seven were calculated (Methods Section). Where are the results for all these other values of k={2, 3, 5 and 7} which were not the k={4 and 6} results of the article? Although other sizes of motifs where apparently used in the analysis, the manuscript focuses on the length-4 motifs. The choice of k=4 for the size of motifs to study is not a very interesting statistic since the probability of a particular length-4 motif showing up randomly in a sequence not very high (1/(4^4) = 1/256). Given that the frequency of mutations, and all the evolutionary time during which to make changes to a sequence, these length=4 similar motifs are likely to randomly turn-up. The authors should consider using the occurrence of motifs which are at least seven since these frequencies begin to become less randomly placed. Length-4 words are already common in many many bacteria as restriction sites for restriction enzymes. The authors will also find that there are restriction sites of length-6 for the same purpose and so they will have to remove all restriction enzyme palindromes from their sets of k=4 or 6 sized motifs if they cannot continue with a longer motif length. However, if they are determining the level of conservation between organisms, then having longer motifs should not hurt their results.Once these issues are addressed, the manuscript will be much stronger. I have read this submission. I believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to state that I do not consider it to be of an acceptable scientific standard, for reasons outlined above.

I have considered the points you raised, and responded in order below. Changes to the manuscript are noted.The usage deviation-based statistics chosen for this paper are similar to those based on the composition vector of a sequence (Bonham-Carter et al., 2013). Usage deviation (tetranucleotide usage deviation, TUD, in the case of k=4) is a vector of the counts of the possible k-mers, normalized to the expected counts in a randomized genome with the same nucleotide composition. I have made additions to the methods section and included a new figure that makes the calculation of usage deviation more clear. The software tools used to perform these calculations have a description at the github page linked in the paper. I have added an example in the methods section that shows how to calculate TUD for a small sequence. Although this example outlines the method, the results are not very informative. The expected number of any 4-mer is very small in a short sequence, resulting in high TUD values for any 4-mers that do occur. We do not make any assumptions about the input data when calculating usage deviation or performing statistics in the paper. I showed trees constructed from other values of k in Figure 2. The relationships between phage genomes were consistent regardless of the value chosen for k. Other analyses mirrored this result, so we proceed exclusively with k={4, 6}. I agree that length-4 motifs are not interesting to study in isolation. Usage deviation, where values represent deviations from expected frequencies, overcome this point. Single occurrences or counts of any 4-mer are uninteresting. Only when counts are normalized and compared in aggregate do the trends that observed in the paper become meaningful. 7-mers would be less randomly placed in the phage genomes analyzed. Similar to the point above, however, the occurrences of singular k-mers are not considered. As k increases, the resulting usage deviation vectors become sparse. Up to 43% of the (4^7=16384) 7-mers are absent from individual genome sequences, and no 7-mer occurs at least once in every genome analyzed. The sparse nature of the data for 7-mers would not be well-suited to some of the analyses presented in this paper (PCA, searching for horizontally transferred segments). I acknowledge that many 4-mers and 6-mers are restriction sites. In fact, this makes the substrings more interesting. B3 mycobacteriophages have 4 times the expected usage of GATC, a restriction site in some bacteria. Biological sense dictates restriction sites would occur infrequently, but the results say the opposite. I do not feel it is necessary to remove restriction sites before the analysis, and doing so would be somewhat arbitrary. The set of restriction sites in mycobacteria species is not entirely characterized, and the host range for each mycobacteriophage has not been studied.We hope you find the answers to the points you raised and the revisions to the paper acceptable.References:Bonham-Carter, O., Steele, J. & Bastola, D.

However, there are only few reports supporting the existence of such cells in human lymphoma cell lines or in transgenic lymphoma mouse models2–5. Our group identified a subset of lymphoid progenitor cells (LPCs) in primary canine B-cell lymphomas that were characterized by co-expression of hematopoietic progenitor antigens CD34, CD117, and CD133, the B-lymphoid lineage marker CD22, and the common leukocyte antigen CD456. These LPCs had phenotypic properties consistent with tumor-initiating or tumor-propagating cells (TIC/TPC); they also persisted in the xenotransplantation setting, suggesting that they were relevant to the biology of this disease in vivo6. When compared with the bulk of the tumor cells, LPCs showed significantly lower expression of 44 genes across the genome, mapping to cell cycle and transmembrane signaling pathways7. This indicated that LPCs exhibit the characteristic “slow proliferation” seen in normal bone marrow-derived hematopoietic stem cells and in TIC/TPC in other cancers.One common feature of TIC/TPC in solid tumors is the expression of ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter proteins such as ABCB1 (multidrug resistance protein-1 or P-glycoprotein) and ABCG2 (breast cancer resistance protein)8. ABC transporter proteins confer drug resistance by actively transporting drugs from the intracellular space to the extracellular space, thereby preventing the interaction of these drugs with their intracellular targets. In the case of ABCB1, expression has been shown to confer resistance to vinca alkaloids, anthracyclines, taxanes, epipodophyllotoxins, and other drugs9,10.Genome-wide gene expression profiling data showed that mRNAs for ABCB1 and ABCG2 were expressed in several types of spontaneous canine lymphomas, including diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL)11. Valspodar (PSC-833) is a selective ABC transporter inhibitor with an acceptable safety profile. Specifically, valspodar had acceptable toxicity when given alone and in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy in Phase I/II clinical trials in humans with several types of cancer and in one study of dogs with naturally occurring osteosarcoma treated with doxorubicin12–16. These favorable toxicological and pharmacokinetic profiles made valspodar an attractive candidate for targeting LPCs, especially because a safe protocol had been previously established for its neoadjuvant use to inhibit ABCB1 in dogs receiving doxorubicin chemotherapy14. This precedent allowed us to test whether valspodar used in a comparable setting would enhance chemosensitivity of LPCs and extend the time in remission for dogs with spontaneous large B-cell lymphomas.","05 Jun 2015","Approved with Reservations","Michael S. Kent, Department of Surgical and Radiological Sciences, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, Davis, CA, USA",NA," The manuscript entitled “A double blinded, placebo-controlled pilot study to examine reduction of CD34+/CD117+/CD133+ lymphoma progenitor cells and duration of remission induced by neoadjuvant valspodar in dogs with large B-cell lymphoma” presents a prospective study evaluating the effects of valspodar in a single agent setting for effects on LPCs  and as a secondary endpoint evaluates outcomes in dogs treated with valspodar and doxorubicin for B-cell lymphoma.The manuscript is well written and describes the study design and materials and methods well.My main concern with the manuscript is that the main outcome studied was a change in LPCs before and 4 days after starting valspodar. Given the mechanism of action of the drug in inhibiting the ABC transporter and not cytotoxcity of these cells specifically I am not surprised that the authors did not see a drop in their numbers.  It is unfortunate that there were only a few samples with enough material to test if valspodar could inhibit the ABC transporters in vivo as this would have been a very useful component of the study. In my opinion these points should be in the discussion. While underpowered I think the length of remission and overall survival data are important as they show that there is not likely to be differences in these groups even in a larger study.  I have read this submission.

It is transmitted by Ixodes ticks and is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) (Burgdorfer et al., 1982). Bb is phylogenetically related to the spirochetal agent of syphilis, Treponema pallidum (Gupta et al., 2013). T. pallidum is transmitted sexually between partners through contact of mucosal membranes, gaining access to the bloodstream through microabrasions and then disseminating systemically (Ho & Lukehart, 2011; LaFond & Lukehart, 2006). The close phylogenic relationship of Bb to T. pallidum suggests that this mode of transmission might be possible for Bb.In addition to theoretical considerations, evidence for non-vector transmission of Bb is based on animal models. Proof of contact transmission of Bb – without involvement of an arthropod vector – was established by two studies in mice. Burgess et al. (1986) caged uninfected deer mice with experimentally-infected deer mice and demonstrated transmission of Bb by seroconversion of contact-exposed mice from negative to positive and by the isolation of Bb from the blood of one contact-exposed mouse 42 days after initial contact. A study by Wright & Nielsen (1990) demonstrated that white-footed mice were susceptible to oral infection and transmitted infection to each other through direct contact. Furthermore, sexual transmission of Bb has been proposed in a canine model. Bb was transmitted to uninfected female dogs in estrus via semen by natural breeding with male dogs infected experimentally with Bb (Gustafson, 1993). Successful transmission of infection from male dogs to female dogs was shown by seroconversion of female dogs from negative to positive as well as the detection of Bb DNA in the tissue of fetuses from resulting pregnancies. If contact transmission of Bb occurs in mice and sexual transfer occurs in dogs, it is not unreasonable to postulate similar routes of infection in humans.We sought to determine if viable Borrelia spirochetes could be recovered from human vaginal and seminal secretions, an important first step to investigate whether sexual transmission of these spirochetes among humans is possible.","11 May 2015","Not Approved","Monica E.

Continue reading The design of these experiments to test the hypothesis that viable spirochetes exist in genital secretions is appropriate. However, the implementation of the experiments, presentation, and interpretation of data is questionable. Culture of B. burgdorferi from secretions: These are not sterile sources, yet there is no mention of contamination with other microbes. The authors should show (supplemental data) staining of secretions and cultures from healthy controls. One would expect some level of background staining.We acknowledge that these are not sterile sources. Three antibiotics were used to limit the growth of normal flora. Although Borrelia cultures may contain other flora, obtaining pure isolates was not the purpose of the study. The negative controls from healthy subjects did not show PCR evidence of spirochetal infection, as seen in Table 5 and Dataset 7. Real-time PCR failed to show spirochetal infection in genital cultures from negative controls (Table 5A), and both TaqMan PCR and nested PCR using a variety of targets failed to show Borrelia infection in genital cultures from negative controls (Table 5B). To address the referee’s concern about control silver staining and immunostaining, however, we have performed additional control silver stains and immunostains using a culture from uninfected mouse plasma, which showed no staining for Borrelia with either technique. Cultures of fungal-infected human skin, mixed gram positive strep and staph (from dairy mastitis cultures) and mixed gram negative fecal coliforms (from canine feces cultured on McConkey Agar) also failed to show significant immunostaining for Borrelia. In contrast, plasma culture from a mouse infected with Borrelia spirochetes processed at McClain Laboratory showed positive silver staining and immunostaining. We have included this information in Datasets 2A and 3A and added a description in the Results section on Pages 8 and 9. Images shown in Figures 1, 2 and 3 are not specifically detecting spirochetes and are questionable without appropriate controls. The darkfield and silver stain are of very little use, given that “pseudospirochetes” of flagellar bundles can forms in body fluid cultures. No positive or negative controls are shown.Figure 1 shows darkfield imaging and silver staining indicating that cultures are living and viable. The Figure shows typical spirochetal morphology, and these viable spirochetes were confirmed to be Borrelia by PCR, as shown in Table 5 and Dataset 7. Figure 2 shows immunostaining that is specific for Borrelia and correlates with positive PCR detection in these samples. Figure 3 shows molecular hybridization with the FlaB probe that is highly specific for Borrelia. The positive and negative controls for this experiment are shown in Supplemental Figure 1. Although each figure by itself might not indicate the presence of Borrelia, the combination of darkfield imaging, silver staining, immunostaining, PCR testing using a range of targets and molecular hybridization provides strong evidence for viable Borrelia in these genital cultures, as stated repeatedly in the article. The straight morphology and varying lengths of that depicted in Figure 1A (and in all of the dataset 1 darkfield samples provided) are inconsistent with B. burgdorferi morphology.We respectfully disagree with the referee, and we have included a discussion of morphological variation and pleomorphism in Borrelia cultures in the Discussion section on Page 16 with multiple references. Furthermore, to our knowledge nobody has ever studied Borrelia in seminal or vaginal cultures, so nobody knows what morphological variants would be present. Since Borrelia morphological variation and pleomorphism is acknowledged in the medical literature, visual identification alone is not reliable and that is why we used silver staining, immunostaining and molecular detection to characterize the isolates as Borrelia. Specific staining shown in Fig 2A is more consistent with spirochete morphology and a legitimate detection method (albeit a low quality image). However, the authors indicate in the Methods section that DAPI counterstain was used but no blue staining is apparent. Does this mean that there were no other sources of DNA in the culture (bacteria or cells)? Clearly, there is ample contamination with other bacteria (seen in darkfield images of dataset 1).We agree with the referee that immunostaining in Figure 2A is consistent with spirochete morphology. The DAPI counterstain was only used in the FlaB probe validation study, as shown in Supplemental Figure 1. We have modified the Methods description to reflect this fact. Concerning immunostaining with the FlaB probe, the methods are not described and no positive or negative control samples are shown. Wth the exception of Patient 10, none of the silver stained samples resemble spirochetes. The FlaB probe is a DNA probe, not an immunostain. This DNA hybridization technique is described in detail in Methods section 5 (Page 4) with appropriate references, and positive and negative controls for the technique are shown in Supplemental Figure 1. Again, we have included references to studies showing morphological variation and pleomorphism in Borrelia cultures in the Discussion section on Page 16.  As there are problems with specificity of visual identification using silver staining, we used this method to provide corroborative evidence only. It is the collective evidence -- including darkfield imaging, immunostaining and molecular detection of borrelial DNA that is important. We used a broad approach with various methods so that there was no reliance on any single methodology, as stated repeatedly in the article. This reviewer encourages readers to examine the images provided in supplementary datasets.We encourage readers to do the same. The Dataset images support the findings described in the article. Concerning the molecular detection, the sequence for the 23mer FlaB DNA probe should be provided, as should evidence of validation with controls.We have provided the FlaB probe sequence in Methods section 5 (Page 4), courtesy of Dr. Alan MacDonald. Again, this is a molecular technique intended to provide corroborative evidence -- along with all the other techniques. A detailed vaildation study was provided in Supplemental Figure 1 clearly showing that the molecular probe was specific for Bb sensu stricto. If multiple genes were amplified from cultures, then those sequences should also be provided. Assuming there was a positive control, 98-100% homology cannot distinguish between a legitimate infection and PCR contamination (with introduction of errors from PCR). The gene sequences are described in Table 6, and BLAST analyses are shown in Dataset 6. The argument against PCR contamination is presented in the Discussion section on Page 17. Sequences from patients 10 and 11 as B. hermsii is misleading, given that they are short, disconnected regions of homology. Given that 16s was used, the entire product should line up. BLAST input was not provided for Patient 12 and the region of homology for patient 13 was only 50 bp (where for patient 1, 6 and 7 it was ~120 bp).The B. hermsii sequences are short, but they were the closest match in those samples. The referee ignores the fact that this couple was the only one with a distinct Borrelia sequence that was detected in both sexual partners and not in any other individual or couple in our small study. The BLAST analysis for Patient 12 was performed using a different program, and labeling for the sequence input has been provided. For Patient 13, the region of homology was short, but it was virtually identical to the sequence in her sexual partner (Patient 12), as shown in Table 6. In conclusion, this manuscript would be made much clearer if all of the control (positive and negative) data were also included. Validation of the assays employed is unapparent. The paper cited from the Australian Biologics assay indicated PCR detection of Borrelia in patients at a much higher frequency than IgG or IgM immunoblot detection of exposure. This is inconsistent with multiple reports. Furthermore, the PCR primers are listed as “proprietary” so an assessment of specificity cannot be made. Sending blinded samples to an impartial 3rd party for testing using validated assays is recommended.As outlined above, we have included control data for the PCR and molecular hybridization testing, which is the “acid test” for the presence of Borrelia in genital cultures. The assays described in our study are internally consistent since the darkfield imaging, silver staining and immunostaining have been validated by the PCR and molecular hybridization procedures. In contrast to the referee’s comment, there is ample evidence for “seronegative” Lyme disease, and we have included a discussion of this entity on Page 16 with appropriate references. We used two independent laboratories for PCR testing and molecular hybridization studies, and the results using a range of primers are consistent between the two laboratories. We intend to send blinded samples to independent laboratories for confirmation of our results. In light of our detailed responses to the referee comments, we believe that this preliminary study merits reconsideration for approval by the referee. The design of these experiments to test the hypothesis that viable spirochetes exist in genital secretions is appropriate. However, the implementation of the experiments, presentation, and interpretation of data is questionable. Culture of B. burgdorferi from secretions: These are not sterile sources, yet there is no mention of contamination with other microbes.

Although Borrelia cultures may contain other flora, obtaining pure isolates was not the purpose of the study. The negative controls from healthy subjects did not show PCR evidence of spirochetal infection, as seen in Table 5 and Dataset 7. Real-time PCR failed to show spirochetal infection in genital cultures from negative controls (Table 5A), and both TaqMan PCR and nested PCR using a variety of targets failed to show Borrelia infection in genital cultures from negative controls (Table 5B). To address the referee’s concern about control silver staining and immunostaining, however, we have performed additional control silver stains and immunostains using a culture from uninfected mouse plasma, which showed no staining for Borrelia with either technique. Cultures of fungal-infected human skin, mixed gram positive strep and staph (from dairy mastitis cultures) and mixed gram negative fecal coliforms (from canine feces cultured on McConkey Agar) also failed to show significant immunostaining for Borrelia. In contrast, plasma culture from a mouse infected with Borrelia spirochetes processed at McClain Laboratory showed positive silver staining and immunostaining. We have included this information in Datasets 2A and 3A and added a description in the Results section on Pages 8 and 9. Images shown in Figures 1, 2 and 3 are not specifically detecting spirochetes and are questionable without appropriate controls. The darkfield and silver stain are of very little use, given that “pseudospirochetes” of flagellar bundles can forms in body fluid cultures. No positive or negative controls are shown.Figure 1 shows darkfield imaging and silver staining indicating that cultures are living and viable. The Figure shows typical spirochetal morphology, and these viable spirochetes were confirmed to be Borrelia by PCR, as shown in Table 5 and Dataset 7. Figure 2 shows immunostaining that is specific for Borrelia and correlates with positive PCR detection in these samples. Figure 3 shows molecular hybridization with the FlaB probe that is highly specific for Borrelia. The positive and negative controls for this experiment are shown in Supplemental Figure 1. Although each figure by itself might not indicate the presence of Borrelia, the combination of darkfield imaging, silver staining, immunostaining, PCR testing using a range of targets and molecular hybridization provides strong evidence for viable Borrelia in these genital cultures, as stated repeatedly in the article. The straight morphology and varying lengths of that depicted in Figure 1A (and in all of the dataset 1 darkfield samples provided) are inconsistent with B. burgdorferi morphology.We respectfully disagree with the referee, and we have included a discussion of morphological variation and pleomorphism in Borrelia cultures in the Discussion section on Page 16 with multiple references. Furthermore, to our knowledge nobody has ever studied Borrelia in seminal or vaginal cultures, so nobody knows what morphological variants would be present. Since Borrelia morphological variation and pleomorphism is acknowledged in the medical literature, visual identification alone is not reliable and that is why we used silver staining, immunostaining and molecular detection to characterize the isolates as Borrelia. Specific staining shown in Fig 2A is more consistent with spirochete morphology and a legitimate detection method (albeit a low quality image). However, the authors indicate in the Methods section that DAPI counterstain was used but no blue staining is apparent. Does this mean that there were no other sources of DNA in the culture (bacteria or cells)? Clearly, there is ample contamination with other bacteria (seen in darkfield images of dataset 1).We agree with the referee that immunostaining in Figure 2A is consistent with spirochete morphology. The DAPI counterstain was only used in the FlaB probe validation study, as shown in Supplemental Figure 1. We have modified the Methods description to reflect this fact. Concerning immunostaining with the FlaB probe, the methods are not described and no positive or negative control samples are shown. Wth the exception of Patient 10, none of the silver stained samples resemble spirochetes. The FlaB probe is a DNA probe, not an immunostain. This DNA hybridization technique is described in detail in Methods section 5 (Page 4) with appropriate references, and positive and negative controls for the technique are shown in Supplemental Figure 1. Again, we have included references to studies showing morphological variation and pleomorphism in Borrelia cultures in the Discussion section on Page 16.  As there are problems with specificity of visual identification using silver staining, we used this method to provide corroborative evidence only. It is the collective evidence -- including darkfield imaging, immunostaining and molecular detection of borrelial DNA that is important. We used a broad approach with various methods so that there was no reliance on any single methodology, as stated repeatedly in the article. This reviewer encourages readers to examine the images provided in supplementary datasets.We encourage readers to do the same. The Dataset images support the findings described in the article. Concerning the molecular detection, the sequence for the 23mer FlaB DNA probe should be provided, as should evidence of validation with controls.We have provided the FlaB probe sequence in Methods section 5 (Page 4), courtesy of Dr. Alan MacDonald. Again, this is a molecular technique intended to provide corroborative evidence -- along with all the other techniques. A detailed vaildation study was provided in Supplemental Figure 1 clearly showing that the molecular probe was specific for Bb sensu stricto. If multiple genes were amplified from cultures, then those sequences should also be provided. Assuming there was a positive control, 98-100% homology cannot distinguish between a legitimate infection and PCR contamination (with introduction of errors from PCR). The gene sequences are described in Table 6, and BLAST analyses are shown in Dataset 6. The argument against PCR contamination is presented in the Discussion section on Page 17. Sequences from patients 10 and 11 as B. hermsii is misleading, given that they are short, disconnected regions of homology. Given that 16s was used, the entire product should line up. BLAST input was not provided for Patient 12 and the region of homology for patient 13 was only 50 bp (where for patient 1, 6 and 7 it was ~120 bp).The B. hermsii sequences are short, but they were the closest match in those samples. The referee ignores the fact that this couple was the only one with a distinct Borrelia sequence that was detected in both sexual partners and not in any other individual or couple in our small study. The BLAST analysis for Patient 12 was performed using a different program, and labeling for the sequence input has been provided. For Patient 13, the region of homology was short, but it was virtually identical to the sequence in her sexual partner (Patient 12), as shown in Table 6. In conclusion, this manuscript would be made much clearer if all of the control (positive and negative) data were also included. Validation of the assays employed is unapparent. The paper cited from the Australian Biologics assay indicated PCR detection of Borrelia in patients at a much higher frequency than IgG or IgM immunoblot detection of exposure. This is inconsistent with multiple reports. Furthermore, the PCR primers are listed as “proprietary” so an assessment of specificity cannot be made. Sending blinded samples to an impartial 3rd party for testing using validated assays is recommended.As outlined above, we have included control data for the PCR and molecular hybridization testing, which is the “acid test” for the presence of Borrelia in genital cultures. The assays described in our study are internally consistent since the darkfield imaging, silver staining and immunostaining have been validated by the PCR and molecular hybridization procedures. In contrast to the referee’s comment, there is ample evidence for “seronegative” Lyme disease, and we have included a discussion of this entity on Page 16 with appropriate references. We used two independent laboratories for PCR testing and molecular hybridization studies, and the results using a range of primers are consistent between the two laboratories. We intend to send blinded samples to independent laboratories for confirmation of our results. In light of our detailed responses to the referee comments, we believe that this preliminary study merits reconsideration for approval by the referee.

These drugs effectively lower glycated hemoglobin levels among patients with type 2 diabetes1. Both these agents have relatively similar efficacy, but may have different adverse effect profiles1–8. Since regulatory approval, the thiazolidinediones have been associated with an increase in the risk of fractures in women, heart failure and, in the case of rosiglitazone, myocardial infarction1–6. Certain immunological adverse effects such as increased risk of bladder cancer7, or acute cholecystitis9, are specific to pioglitazone.Rosiglitazone is a PPAR<U+03B3> agonist, whereas pioglitazone has both a and <U+03B3> effects. PPAR<U+03B3> activation may result in glucorticoid like effects in the airways10–12. These effects could induce susceptibility to pneumonia similar to the effect of glucorticoids in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease13. In human macrophages the thiazolidinediones have off-target effects on PPARd at clinically relevant doses14–17. This augmentation of PPARd signaling by the thiazolidinediones may potentially exhibit proinflammatory activities such as pneumonia14,15.Patients with type 2 diabetes are known to be at a higher risk of pneumonia18,19. A large, long term clinical trial7, and a meta-analysis of long term clinical trials raised the possibility that long term use (> one year) of the thiazolidinediones may increase the risk of pneumonia6. We aimed to test the hypothesis that the use of rosiglitazone or pioglitazone was associated with an increased risk of pneumonia in patients with type 2 diabetes.","09 May 2014","Approved with Reservations","Hans-Peter Hammes, Department of Medicine, University of Heidelberg, Germany",NA," The manuscript addresses the question whether PPAR-<U+03B3> agonists can induce pneumonia as indicated by prior RCTs. The authors used administrative data sets and a new user design recruiting more than one million patients. Of these patients, a subgroup of > 6000 “cases” (i.e. age between 18 and 64, diabetes prior to pneumonia, one episode of pneumonia, no CHF) was matched with an identical number of  diabetic patients without pneumonia “controls”.Statistical analysis revealed a higher number of COPD patients in the pneumonia group (which is expected). After adjusting for important confounders of pneumonia (such as COPD, cancer, tobacco use and vaccination) the use of PPAR-<U+03B3> agonists was not associated with higher incidence of pneumonia. In fact, a decreased odds ratio was found when current exposure of rosiglitazone was plotted against pneumonia. Overall, the authors conclude that there is no increased risk of pneumonia, when using PPAR-<U+03B3> agonists.In general, the paper is of high clinical relevance, only presently limited by the fact the TZDs are almost off market because the spectrum of side effects. There are a few points of possible amendments:Introduction: the difference between the two TZDs is likely not relevant with regard to pneumonia development. This should be mentioned. Introduction: reference 19 involves Type 1 diabetic patients – the pathogenesis of increased susceptibility is different, therefore a ref. restricted to type 2 diabetes is preferable. M&M and result section: one of the most important determinants of infections in diabetic patients is metabolic control. Are there data on blood glucose, or HbA1c of the two groups to identify a possible additional confounder? Moreover, data on the current use of steroids would be helpful as the proportion of COPD is different between the two groups. M&M and result section: important anthropometric data from both patient groups are lacking, such as age, known diabetes duration, and comorbidities. Are there any available data that could be incorporated? Discussion section: specify the confounders that were explicitly addressed. Future research: the current status of TZD approval with the FDA and EMA should be incorporated here.    I have read this submission.

Similarly, Grau et al., (2014) were able to induce the conscious perception of light flashes to a participant, triggering a robotized transcranial magnetic stimulation by a signal generated from the EEG correlates of the voluntary motor imagery from a partner located 5,000 miles apart and transmitted via the Internet.Even though there is cultural resistance in accepting the possibility of observing similar effects in humans without an internet connection, some evidence of these effects nevertheless exists. A comprehensive search of all studies related to this line of research has revealed at least eighteen studies from 1974 until the present time (see Supplementary Material).In all these studies the principal aim was to observe whether the brain activity evoked by a stimulus (e.g. by presenting light flashes or images) in one member of a couple, could also be observed in the brain of the partner. Even if some of these studies, those using functional neuroimaging, can be criticized for potential methodological weaknesses that could account for the reported effects (Acunzo et al., 2013), the questions is still open as to whether or not it is possible to connect two human brains at distance.The possibility of connecting the brains of two humans at distance without using any classical means of transmission is theoretically expected if it is assumed that two brains, and consequently two minds, can be entangled in a quantum-like manner. In quantum physics, entanglement is a physical phenomenon that occurs when pairs (or groups) of particles interact in ways such that the measurement (observation) of the quantum state (e.g. spin state) of each member is correlated with the others, irrespective of their distance without apparent classical communication.At present, generalizability from physics variables to biological and mental variables can be done only by analogy given the differences in their properties, but some theoretical models are already available. For example in the Generalized Quantum Theory (Filk & Römer, 2011; Von Lucadou & Romer, 2007; Walach & von Stillfried, 2011), “entanglement can be expected to occur if descriptions of the system that pertain to the whole system are complementary to descriptions of parts of the system. In this case the individual elements within the system, that are described by variables complementary to the variable describing the whole system, are non-locally correlated”.Reasoning by analogy, we hypothesized the possibility of entangling two minds, and consequently two brains as complementary parts of a single system and studying their interactions at distance without any classical connections.In a pilot study, Tressoldi et al., (2014) tested five couples of participants with a long friendship and a capacity to maintain a focused mental concentration, who were separated by a distance of approximately five meters without any sensorial contact. Three sequences of silence-signal events lasting two and half minutes and one minute, respectively, were delivered to the first member of the pair. The second member of the pair was simply requested to connect mentally with his/her partner. A total of fifteen pairs of data were analyzed. By using a special classification algorithm, these authors observed an overall percentage of correct coincidences of 78%, ranging from 100% for the first two segments silence-signal, to approximately 43% in the last two. The percentages of coincidences in the first five segments of the protocol were above 80%. Furthermore a robust statistically significant correlation was observed in all but beta EEG frequency bands, but was much stronger in the alpha band.These preliminary results of the pilot study prompted us to devise this pre-registered replication study.","24 Oct 2014","Not Approved","Sam Schwarzkopf, Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London, UK","Author Response 24 Oct 2014"," I thank the authors for this newly revised version of their manuscript. Unfortunately, while they carried out some of the analyses we discussed, the evidence still does not support their claims, even though the claims have now been toned down. However, before I elaborate on this point I feel I must first discuss a more general point.It is not a secret that I am an outspoken critic of ‘psi’ research, that is, experiments seeking to demonstrate the existence of purported extra sensory perception, telepathy, psychokinesis, precognition etc. My prior belief in such phenomena is presumably very different from that of the authors of this manuscript. But this raises an important question: What level of evidence should suffice to accept their findings and approve this manuscript?The way I see it, the purpose of this review is not to evaluate the claim that there is a telepathic link (the authors don’t use this term but this is what is implied) between brains at any distance. The authors would need far more compelling evidence to convince me that this is actually a possibility but this is not really the claim put forth by this manuscript. Rather the claim is that there is an as yet unexplained phenomenon that appears like a telepathic link. The authors have however been very clear from the beginning that future research needs to strengthen this evidence. They write in the conclusions: ‘Only multiple independent replications and further controls on further potential methodological and statistical artifacts can support this hypothesis…’But of course this statement applies to any scientific result. Only replication and appropriate controls can really strengthen our confidence in a hypothesis. However, this does not imply that we should accept every small result as tentative or preliminary result. Even an infinite number of replications would be completely worthless if the basic premise of the experiment is not sound. My review is therefore not about the evidence for the telepathy hypothesis but about the claim that something as-yet unexplained has been observed at all. I do not think the evidence supports this statement for the following reasons: 1. Main analysis is meaninglessMost of my previous reviews focused on a major conceptual flaw in the main analysis used by the authors. They decode the presence of a signal using data within each individual and randomly splitting the data samples into training and test sets. My reanalysis with two different non-linear classifiers (a SVM similar to that used by the authors as well as a k-nearest-neighbour algorithm) suggests that training and testing on completely arbitrary stimulus labels produces almost perfect decoding performance, provided that the epochs are not too short (a few seconds seem to suffice). Presumably this is because temporal correlations between adjacent time samples (which I previously demonstrated exist in the raw data) will break down when labels are defined completely at random.The authors have not addressed this issue at all. They do not report any attempt to repeat my analysis using their classifier but only state that they repeat their original analysis five times to show it is robust. This does not address the issue, however, because it does not matter how the training and test data sets are randomised. It will produce similar findings every time because of temporal correlations between adjacent samples.In essence, this means that the main analysis, which remains the primary result in the new version of the manuscript, is completely confounded. Unless the authors can provide evidence that this does not happen for their own classifier, which to my understanding is based on a publicly available implementation of SVM (LibSVM) that in my experience does not differ dramatically from the one I used in my reanalyses, and, if so, a compelling explanation why that might be the case, I do not see any way this analysis can be accepted. It simply shows that decoding within participant works due to temporal correlations. Therefore this entire analysis should be removed. 2. Cross-participant analysis is confoundedThe authors performed an analysis we discussed in the comments on the previous version of this manuscript. They used data from the Sender in each pair to train the classifier and then decode using the data recorded from the Receiver. This would be a better test because it shouldn’t be confounded by temporal correlations in each participant’s time series and it also directly tests the question whether there is actually any similarity in the EEG signals between the two brains. In my previous attempts to perform such an analysis, I only did this on a handful of pairs and found no evidence of above chance decoding. This is consistent with the author’s new results that this Sender-to-Receiver decoding only works for 5 of the pairs. As I said in my previous review, considering that there are some correlations between the time series for different participants it isn’t terribly surprising that there should also be some cross-participant decoding.The authors therefore also performed a control analysis by training on Senders from these 5 ‘successful’ pairs showing cross-participant decoding but testing on unpaired Receivers. They report that training on Sender 13 results in similar accuracy when testing the classifier on data from Receiver 7, 8, 10, 14, 16, 17, and 18. What they do not mention is that these are all Receivers for whom the first stimulus period was perfectly correlated with that of Sender 13. For Sender 8 they report only good correspondence with Receiver 10 and for the remaining three ‘successful’ pairs they reported no correspondences. This in itself appears questionable because inspection of the NewCoincidences files suggest that there appear to be some rather obvious ‘coincidences’ in the decoding for training on Sender 8 with Receivers 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 14, 17, 18, and 20. There are also many traces for which the decoded neither classified the trace as signal nor as silence. It still is unclear to me what this means. Typically a SVM classifier will assign either one or the other label so it is puzzling why these data are missing. By and large this also again raises the question why the authors chose to classify events based on these ‘coincidences’ instead of actually quantifying the classification performance directly.Regardless of these issues, what these data show is that cross-participant decoding is not very impressive. Even if we accept that cross-participant decoding works only for 4 of the 20 pairs this still does not really suggest that something very unusual is happening. This only actually reflects a small number of events being classified correctly – by my count 5 out of 34 signal events, if we follow the authors way to quantify ‘coincidences’.Importantly, the authors also perform a similar cross-pair analysis to quantify the strength of correlations between time series from different participants. This clearly suggests that the correlations they observed for the alpha and gamma bands within pairs are actually extremely close (and with overlapping confidence intervals) as those observed between pairs. This suggests that there are simply strong correlations in the EEG time series between different people regardless of whether they were paired up or not. These correlations are particularly strong for the alpha band, which makes sense considering the relaxing experimental conditions under which the recordings were conducted. It may also reflect anticipatory behaviour or imagery the participants could have engaged in – a notion the authors reject as impossible although they didn’t actually test this possibility. Or perhaps it could also relate to slow fluctuations in gamma power that this experimental design didn’t control for because the stimulus protocol was always 30 s of signal followed by 60 s of silence. In any case, considering these correlations across pairs it seems not overly surprising that there should be some decoding when training on Senders and testing on Receivers in some pairs. 3. Other outstanding issuesThe authors also made no effort to address some of the perhaps more minor concerns. The binomial test on the decoding when both signal and silence events are combined is still statistically incorrect. It simply is not true that the chance level is 50% because there were fewer signal events than silence events. For unbalanced designs a classifier will frequently not assign events/trials with a probability of 50%. The appropriate way to test for significant decoding would be to use a permutation test. The fact that the Bayes Factor in this test was 360,625 should raise suspicion. Rather than being interpreted as overwhelming evidence such a result is usually either completely trivial or a hint of an artifact.The authors also still claim that the initial silence period was randomised to be 1, 2, or 3 minutes, which according to the traces is clearly not correct. The initial silence was either 1 or 2 minutes which means there was less randomisation than the authors claim. The authors also do not even begin to discuss the high colinearity between the stimulus protocols used in the 20 pairs and how this could have influenced the predictability of the design or even the correlation between whether any given epoch was a signal or silence period and the state of the EEG time series. The authors previously suggested that it would apparently be impossible for participants to predict the sequence. I am not convinced by this argument but even if we take it at face value this does not preclude order effects. ConclusionEven if some of these issues could be addressed by a further revision, as I discussed here and in my previous reviews, the numerous issues with inadequate randomisation and lack of control conditions lead me to think that only a complete overhaul of this experiment could begin to address these problems properly. More importantly, as this is now the third revision of the manuscript I feel confident in saying that the discussion is going in circles (two points are insufficient evidence to confirm circularity but three are just about enough). I am happy I was given the chance to review this manuscript. Looking into these raw data has been educational for me and this has been my first experience with a totally transparent review process. I have long advocated making review comments public. However, I believe a reviewer's job is to provide an expert's opinion about manuscript. It is not to make a judgment about whether a study should or should not have been published. With the F1000Research publishing model this is the decision of the readers, and I also do not believe that such a decision should be made solely based on one reviewer’s comments. In a situation like this, where two reviewers clearly disagree, ideally a third expert opinion should be sought to adjudicate. Alternatively, the readers may decide to weight the two reviews based on what they perceived is fair and accurate. In any case, I do not think I can contribute any more useful information to this discussion. I believe I have evaluated this manuscript as thoroughly as I can. Perhaps I missed or misunderstood something fundamental. The beauty of the transparent review process is that anyone can identify these shortcomings and use them to reach their final decision. I have read this submission. I believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to state that I do not consider it to be of an acceptable scientific standard, for reasons outlined above.

Many studies have shown that these cardiac arrests are rarely sudden, as demonstrated by abnormal vital signs in the hours leading up to these events1–7. The challenge lies in developing robust algorithms to predict cardiac arrests in order to better target interventions. In fact, one potential explanation for the failure of rapid response systems (RRS) to better impact patient outcomes is an inability to identify which patients actually require RRS intervention8.The Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) is one attempt at a risk prediction algorithm. This scale, which assigns point values for abnormal vital signs or mental status assessments, has been used to predict requirement for hospital admission in emergency department patients9 and to predict hospital mortality10. However, although a vital sign-based tool is appealing for general ward patients, it is limited by the quality of the data, specifically with respect to respiratory rate and mental status, which are poorly assessed and documented outside the intensive care unit. In addition, physiology-based tools do not take into account what has been done to the patient to maintain that physiology, such as the use of supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation or vasopressor agents to maintain blood pressure.In the ICU setting, scales such as the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA)11 have been developed to account for both physiology and supportive measures, but have not been validated for use outside the ICU. Yet another ICU scale with the potential to fill this critical role for floor patients is the 28-item Therapeutic Interventions Scoring System (TISS-28)12. This system was designed to quantify nursing workload in the intensive care setting, and as such does not include any physiology-based scales. Rather, the scale assesses the intensity of caregiver interventions such as the frequency of vital signs, use of invasive catheters and drains, and the frequency and intensity of certain treatments.We hypothesized that a scoring system that includes supportive measures and interventions (such as the SOFA and/or TISS-28) would be superior to a system relying only on physiology (such as the MEWS) in detecting clinical deterioration preceding cardiac arrest on the floors.","03 Feb 2014","Approved with Reservations","José Machado, Computer Science and Technology Center, University of Minho, Portugal",NA," This article presents a study that compares three forecasting models used in healthcare.The models are based on scores for predicting cardiac arrests. The idea is useful and the theme is very important due to the huge number of people that are affected by cardiac arrests worldwide. However, there are some gaps that are crucial to validate the success of the study. The small sample is indeed the main flaw of this study and consequently, it compromises the results interpretation. It is very dangerous to take solid conclusions with just a few examples. In other words, the reliability of this study is not enough to evaluate and to compare these three forecasting models.

Obed and Adewole (1994)9 showed that it increased the Bishop’s score in women with unripe cervices. Sciscione et al.10 stated that the Foley’s catheter appears to be superior to prostaglandins for pre-induction cervical ripening. Its use is common in poor countries because it is safe, inexpensive and have low incidence of contractile abnormalities11.This study was designed to investigate whether the insertion of a weighted fluid filled trans-cervical Foley’s catheter would further improve the effectiveness of 400 µg vaginal misoprostol in terminating mid trimester pregnancies.","12 Feb 2013","Approved with Reservations","Nathan Fox, Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Science, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, USA",NA," I have reviewed the second version of the article, however I still have reservations about it:1. Even though the authors explained why they did not randomize the work it is still something that is required for a study of this type. 2. There are only two baseline characteristics (age and gestational age) which I don’t think are sufficient.3. I still maintain the authors should report that actual p-value. I disagree with their assertion that it would “confuse the reader with too many numbers”.4. With regards to the newly added power analysis, I am unable to reproduce their calculation and thus I think it is mathematically incorrect. Furthermore, since they planned on subdividing the groups by gestational age, this means they are underpowered for each of the subgroups. 5. I also find it hard to believe that the data was normally distributed in such a small sample size. In the subgroup analysis, there were only a handful of patients in each arm. A t-test cannot be the appropriate statistical test. I have read this submission. I believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard, however I have significant reservations, as outlined above.

The incidence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) amongst patients undergoing bariatric surgery has been shown previously to be 71%2.

Patients with OSA have a higher rate of postoperative complications4,5.We investigated if patients with OSA undergoing laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery have an increased risk of postoperative respiratory events and desaturations in the first postoperative night.

Among these concerns is that the three groups are unbalanced regarding co-morbidities, and the documentation of type of anesthesia other than sedation and narcotic medications, and indeed specification of the type of surgery each patient underwent is lacking. For example, did any patients receive general anesthesia? Was there pre-operative intubation?In addition, there is also no analysis offered to determine power in order to assess significant differences among groups and similarly, no simultaneous comparison (e.g., ANOVA) among the 3 groups of interest; OSA, OSA (compliant and non compliant). Patient selection for CPAP was apparently not standardized, nor was the use of PAP post-operatively standardized or protocolized. It is also not clear from the study description how much O2 supplementation was provided and under what conditions (e.g., awake, sleep) was it allowed prior to considering a “deviation from the standard protocol”. Overall, there is a lack of standardization of the approach immediately, preoperatively, perioperatively, and post operatively emerging from the study description. Furthermore, there is no clear physiologic or clinical rationale regarding the use of CPAP pre-surgery being protective in this setting, a crucial consideration and an important conclusion one might have made given the gist of these results, particularly since the “no OSA” group likely contained OSA patients. “Compliance” itself was not documented either subjectively or objectively and many upper airway obstruction events were seen even in the “non OSA” group. Additionally, there was no apparent standardization of approach pre-surgically for the identification and treatment of OSA or for any other pulmonary co-morbidities.Therefore, there is no clear imperative here from which to draw conclusions regarding post operative complication risk, as the overall non-standardization of the methodology and the allowance of clinical bias and design unbalance compromises the scientific validity of such data. Thus, while the subject is of great interest and importance, adjudication regarding the importance of identification and pre-, peri-, and post- operative treatment of OSA in obese patients undergoing the particular bariatric procedure these patients underwent continues to warrant randomized clinical trials rather than retrospective data.

It is thought that amblyopia results from inadequate stimulation of the fovea or peripheral retina and/or abnormal binocular interaction, resulting in different visual input from the foveae2. It has been estimated to affect 2–5% of the population3. The global prevalence of amblyopia has not significantly changed over the years4.Amblyopia results in the loss of binocular vision, which is manifested as absent stereoscopic depth perception, poor spatial acuity, low contrast sensitivity and reduced sensitivity to motion5. This can be detected clinically by assessing whether the patient has difficulty seeing three-dimensional images on autostereograms6.Amblyopic patients can have poor spatial acuity, low contrast sensitivity, and reduced sensitivity to motion5. They may also have poor binocular vision and limited depth perception which can be detected on autostereograms6.The largest study on patient response to amblyopia therapy to date was conducted by the Pediatric Eye Disease Investigator Group (PEDIG) in the USA7, which reported that amblyopia due to strabismus and/or anisometropia responds similarly to part-time occlusion therapy in children between the ages of three and seven years. PEDIG also reported that about 75% of children with previously untreated amblyopia respond to treatment with only two or more lines of improvement on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart up to 18 years of age8. The upper age limit for optimal therapy was considered to be in the range of nine to ten years9–11. The American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends that all children be considered for treatment of amblyopia, regardless of age12.Recent findings in neuroplasticity have replaced the formerly-held position that the brain is a physiologically static organ and have shown that it changes throughout life13. Much evidence of neuroplasticity has been found in adults14,15. According to Levi and Polat, significant improvement of Vernier acuity in adult amblyopes occurred following stereoacuity by using 3-D video games14. Similar findings were announced by researchers of the Goldschleger Eye Research Institute, Tel Aviv University16. The mean improvement in distance and near acuity in amblyopic eyes by 12 months was 3.3 and 1.9 lines log MAR (minimum angle of resolution) respectively.In 2009, a study conducted by MK Mallah and coworkers at Queen's University17, Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast, Ireland, showed that older people (60–80 years) with a history of amblyopia who develop visual loss in the previously normal eye can experience recovery of visual function in the amblyopic eye over a 12 month period. This recovery in visual function occurred following visual loss in the other, previously normal, eye; distance improved to 3.3 lines and near to 1.9 lines log MAR. This improvement appeared to be sustained.There are unsubstantiated beliefs that it is more difficult to treat amblyopia in older age groups, that children that have already received failed amblyopia therapy do not respond to treatment and that full-time occlusion therapy may result in occlusion (disuse) amblyopia of the good eye. The aim of this study was to assess whether these beliefs are true.","30 Sep 2013","Not Approved","James Loughman, Department of Optometry, College of Sciences and Health, Dublin Institute of Technology, Ireland","Author Response 15 Mar 2014"," Irfan et al. have reported on the efficacy of occlusion therapy in severe amblyopia among subjects aged 3 to 35. The authors present a series of interesting, but somewhat surprising results. Most notably the authors conclude that (a) any degree of amblyopia can be resolved with full time occlusion therapy, with almost 100% success even in those aged 13 to 35, in reaching and maintaining 6/6 acuity, and (b) that amblyopia correction is an effective treatment for strabismus, creating orthophoria in almost two-thirds of cases. These findings are potentially groundbreaking, but are so contrary to conventional clinical experience (including experience in the days when full time occlusion was routine), and to the extensive body of prior research evidence (some of which, including the PEDIG study are cited by the authors), that a serious and in-depth evaluation of the scientific robustness of the study methods and interpretation of reported findings is needed.   Although it is beyond the scope of a short review such as this to explore the flaws in substantial detail, I will outline in brief, a number of significant flaws in the study methods and interpretation of findings as presented in this manuscript.   The study sample is very poorly described. For example, we are not given any idea as to the degree of anisometropia, the type (e.g. accommodative) and magnitude of strabismus, or participants’ past ocular history. Patient history is a very important potential confounder that is not at all addressed in this study. The reader is left clueless as to key factors such as why the participants have been referred to the clinic, whether they have undergone any previous ocular treatment (possibly including occlusion therapy) or whether they have previously worn spectacles among many other unknown factors. The inclusion criteria allow for participation of subjects having “failed” previous occlusion therapy, yet there is no information at all as to how many of such participants were included, or how the investigators deemed that past therapy had indeed “failed”. Without such information, the reader simply cannot be certain as to whether the study participants have true amblyopia, or simply took some time to adapt to new spectacles.   The study methodology is certainly unclear, and most likely flawed. For example, the authors state that the optician was masked as to the subjects’ demographics. Quite how an investigator can be masked to patient demographics is beyond me (e.g. a child age 3 versus an adult age 31).   Another important aspect is the acuity chart used. Firstly, the Snellen and Kay’s picture charts are inappropriate for amblyopia assessment, but that remains a minor point. The major concern is whether the same chart and series of letters was used throughout the study. The methods describe that subjects were assessed at a minimum of every 2 weeks (and much more frequently for those under 7, such as every 5 days for 4 year olds). VA in the amblyopic eye was assessed first, then in the normal eye. Surely, the failure to randomise charts and letters is potentially a major flaw in the study (the reader must assume that letter or chart randomisation did not occur as it is not stated as a prescribed method). The effect of learning could be truly substantial, with subjects becoming increasingly familiar with the charts and letters at every visit. Despite even the best of participant intentions, such a learning effect would be impossible to avoid and could entirely explain the results observed in older observers. Although the authors dismiss it as not within the scope of their paper, I am unclear as to the reasons why the reported improvements in stereopsis are not explored in detail in the manuscript. Surely, a paper concerned with neural plasticity in older age groups should report on stereopsis when the test has been included in the study protocol.   I am further concerned by the authors’ interpretation of the effect of occlusion therapy on strabismus, stating that “Out of these 82 cases, 51 cases (62.19%) became orthophoric once their amblyopia was fully corrected while only 31 cases (37.80%) needed surgery for strabismus correction once their vision was restored in the amblyopic eye”. The effect of refractive correction on the reported strabismus is not explored in the paper. Inspection of the amblyopia data provided reveals, as would be expected, a strong relationship between refractive error type and strabismus type (i.e. esotropia mostly associated with hyperopia, and exotropia with myopia). It would seem entirely more likely that the actual reason that strabismus is rendered orthophoric, simply relates to the provision of appropriate spectacles, and not to occlusion therapy success as described. Accommodative esotropia, for example, remains the most common cause of childhood esotropia, and is readily treated with spectacle provision, not requiring surgery.   This study simply does not stand up to proper scientific scrutiny. The methods are flawed, the interpretation is inaccurate, and the results are most likely explained away by factors not explored in the paper. I am concerned that this article could potentially create confusion among the general public and possibly even among clinicians inexperienced in the art of evaluating scientific publications. I have read this submission. I believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to state that I do not consider it to be of an acceptable scientific standard, for reasons outlined above.

However in the mean time I would like to add the following comments to my original study:1) All cases included in the study had dense amblyopia with a visual acuity of 6/60 or 6/36 Snellen's, the other eye being 6/6.This is a third world country with a patient pool which is totally neglected. There is hardly any visual screening in schools hence the anisometropic amblyopia worsens with age. When we started the study, we planned to include all amblyopic cases with at least a 3 lines difference of visual acuity between the two eyes. However, upon conclusion of the study, we were surprised to find that all consecutive cases had at least 6-7 lines difference between the two eyes.2) In the Snellen's chart there are 7 lines, with 1 letter in the first line, 2 in the second, 3 in the third, 4 letters in the 4th line, 5 in the 5th line, 6 in the 6th line and 7 in the 7th line.3) All cases of organic amblyopia were excluded from the study. That included cases with dense corneal opacities in children, macular scarring or optic atrophy.4) Cases with sensory deprivation were included: 2 cases had unilateral traumatic cataract at the age of 4 years. They had cataract surgery with intraocular lens implant at the age of 5 and 7 years and were referred for the management of amblyopia post-operatively.5) Out of the total of 105 cases included in the study, 39 (37.14%) had a past history of being treated with part-time occlusion therapy for 2-6 hours for a period of 3-5 months - 22 out of 41 cases in Group B, (8 - 12 years old); and 17 out of 36 cases in Group C. Since it only improved their vision to 2-3 lines, the parents and the patients ceased treatment which resulted in regression of amblyopia.6) All cases had minimal refractive error in the good eye with an uncorrected vision of 6/6. The 37.14% cases of Group B and C wore corrective glasses only for a 6 month period while part-time occlusion therapy was done. Since it did not significantly improve their vision, the patients stopped wearing glasses. The remaining 62.86% were never prescribed glasses.7) The degree of anisometropia: anisomyopia of -5.5D to -12 with a mean of -6.5D, anisohypermetropia of +3.5 - +6.00 with a mean of +4.00 D was present.8) An important objection raised by the referees is that the same charts were used at each follow-up visit and the probability of learning or memorizing the letters in each line can therefore not be ruled out. We submitted this paper for publication in July 2013 and after receiving these objections, we are now assessing the visual acuity on both the Snellen's and the ETDRS charts in all follow-up cases since the last seven months and have found similar results. An amblyopic eye that cannot appreciate two letters on the second line of Snellen's chart is densely amblyopic and at the end of therapy, if it can read all 7 letters clearly on either a Snellen's or the last line (tenth line) ETDRS then surely that is a huge success. The ETDRS charts include pictures and E letters which we are now using for illiterate children.9) We did not mention the improvement in stereopsis in detail in the paper as we wanted to write another detailed paper on this later. Since our follow-up on all the treated cases has continued, the stereopsis as tested by the Titmus Stereo test at 40cm with patients wearing polarised spectacles over their refractive glasses, has gradually improved from 800"" to 100"" and from 60 to 40 seconds of arc in all cases who have achieved 6/6 Snellen’s or 1.0 on the ETDRS charts.10) In response to the referee's objection that the actual reason the strabismus has been rendered orthophoric is due to the provision of appropriate spectacles and not due to occlusion therapy success. I would like to respond that it is important to realize that a densely amblyopic,  esotropic eye will not become orthophoric with full hypermetropic correction worn for 3-6 months or even longer unless its vision has improved to 6/6 Snellen's or 1.0 ETDRS and that is a fact. In dense amblyopes/amblyopia, the brain needs to be retrained to start seeing clearly with both eyes and that can only be achieved by occluding the good eye full-time to avoid brain-confusion.11) The time allowed for refractive adaptation: we allowed only 4-6 weeks for refractive adaptation though the referees have recommended a minimum of 18 weeks.After 4-6 weeks of continuous spectacle wear, we found only 1-2 line improvement in vision so instead of waiting further, occlusion therapy was started. I agree with the referees that if we had allowed more time, some more improvement in vision might have occurred but still they cannot deny the role of occlusion therapy in achieving a 100% improvement in vision which cannot be achieved with refractive correction alone no matter how long it is worn.12) A 100% improvement in visual acuity means as compared to the other normal eye which was 6/6 Snellen's or 1.0 ETDRS.

There are many databases like RefSeq (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/) that store amino acid sequences and their corresponding functions. However, almost all protein functional prediction methods rely on the identification, characterization, or quantification of sequence similarities between the available proteins of interest1. Even sequences that are similar do not necessarily have identical function. A sequence may be similar to many other sequences, so it can be difficult to choose the most appropriate one. In addition, there is no way to deduce function if there are no similar sequences in any available database.At present, many machine learning research methods are being applied to deal with the above mentioned problems. Two examples are, Support Vector Machines (SVM); a supervised learning model which is mainly used for classification and regression analysis, and network-based methods such as protein interactome networks2,3. In addition, the sequence features, structures, evolution of amino acid sequences, and other characteristics are also utilized for functional prediction4,5.The same sequence may have different meanings in different contexts. Different sequences may also represent the same meaning. These problems are normally called “lexically/structurally ambiguous” in the language translation field. Current machine translation research could effectively avoid these problems by building a translation model between two ‘languages’.Since many amino acid sequences and their corresponding functional description are already publically available, it is possible to build their translation relationships by mature machine translation technology. We address this task in this paper. When presented with a new amino acid sequence we aimed to provide a function-based translation.To build the model, we need to construct the “parallel corpus” of amino acid sequences and their functional descriptions. The term “parallel corpus” is typically used in linguistic areas to refer to texts that are translations of each other. A parallel corpus contains the data for two languages.For example, a parallel corpus from English to French translation:English sentence: I love applesFrench sentence: J’adore les pommesHere, we selected amino acid sequences and their functional descriptions in Gene Ontology form to build the corpus6. The reason for using the Gene Ontology is that it gives the unified descriptions for protein functions of all species. The Gene Ontology data can be found on the website www.geneontology.org (http://www.geneontology.org/GO.downloads.annotations.shtml). The corresponding amino acid sequence data can be downloaded from the website www.uniprot.org (http://www.uniprot.org/downloads), which is a central repository of amino acid sequence. We use the database ID to identify a sequence and find its correspondences in above two data sources.An example of a parallel corpus from “amino acid sequence” to “function” translation:Amino acid sequence (amino acid): MTMDKSELVQKAKLAEQAERYDDMAAAMKAVTEQGHELSNEERNLLSVAYKNVV Function description (Gene ontology term ID): 0005737 0006605 0019904 0035308 0042470 0042826 0043085 The basic idea of machine translation is very simple. It tries to infer “rules” from the parallel corpus and build a translation model. The “rules” are mainly the words or phrase correspondences between two languages. Similar sequences will get near translation results. Although the application of translation technology in protein functional prediction seems reasonably simple, as far as we know, there is no existing program that applies machine translation to protein sequence function analysis.","22 Oct 2014","Not Approved","Juliana Bernardes, Programa de Engenharia de Sistemas e Computação, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","Author Response 05 Nov 2013"," The paper present a new method to predict protein function based on machine translation concepts. In this scenario, protein sequences and their gene ontology terms are interpreted as words in different languages. The idea is to find the best translation for a protein sequence, that is, its most likely gene ontology terms. The method has two phase: training and inference. During the training, protein sequences are broken into several segments and then these segments are related to gene ontology terms. This mapping between protein segments and gene ontology terms constitutes the parallel corpus and it is learned during the training phase. Next, the inference is carried out by an statistical machine translation system that translates a new protein sequence into gene ontology terms  by using the collection of translated pairs (parallel corpus) learned previously.My main issue with this paper is the way how sequences are broken into segments. It is well known that some segments such as motifs and domains are essential to predict protein functions. The author must explore them to enrich their model. A second point concerning the results, they are disappointing. The method did not outperform BLAST that is one of the simpler existing method for protein function prediction. The comparison was not properly done, what is the false positive rates for both methods? Authors must compare the methods by using classical measures such as precision, recall and F-measure and a ROC curve could be plotted. Moreover, the authors did not compare their approach with state-of-art methods such as SVM and HMMs. The discussion of results is really poor, the authors did not defend their method.The training and testing strategy is unusual. 95% of the data to train and just 5% to test, the author have performed a cross validation? If yes how many folds? how many times it was repeated? It is not clear in the text.The paper is not well written and there are several incompressible parts. Just to cite some of them:""Then we use a phrase-based translation model to build the “amino acid sequence” to “protein function” translation model. (I think it is  ""to map"" instead of ""to build"") Here we build three groups of gene parallel corpora. Group 1 only contains human amino acid data. (the expression “human amino acid data” is so unusual in bioinformatics community).The author wrote in the conclusion ""Since the protein functional prediction problem is so close to ‘language translation’, translation based protein functional prediction is likely to be the most promising approach.""I do not agree that protein functional prediction is close to language translation problem. There are a lot additional points, for example evolution. In my opinion, we cannot interpret proteins as words. Anyway, the results have not showed that it is the most promising approach. I have read this submission. I believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to state that I do not consider it to be of an acceptable scientific standard, for reasons outlined above.

Asides from language translation, translation models are also applied in query rewrite, multi-label classification and many other areas. Because protein functional prediction could be regarded as a kind of multi-label classification problem (one sequence to several GO terms), we argue that one could use translation methods in protein functional prediction. 2: The referee requests more evaluations - There still seems to be no standard data set and evaluation methods for protein functional predictions. We will find a proper data set and try different evaluation metrics. More available function prediction methods will also be tried.
