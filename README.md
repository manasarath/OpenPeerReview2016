# OpenPeerReview2016
This project is carried out in the academic year 2015-16 under the supervision of Prof. Peiling Wang at the School of Information Sciences, University of Tennessee (Knoxville).
The project comprises of three sub research topics:
  - Data Scrapping project
  - Qualitative Resarch Project 

The Data Scrapping project was first begun while I was taking the Text Mining class at Haslam Business School. In this project I tried to study to what extent the scientific community adopt the Open Peer Review Publication Model.
