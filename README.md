# OpenPeerReview2016

The Open Peer Review (OPR) project is carried out in the academic year 2015-16 under the supervision of Prof. Peiling Wang at the School of Information Sciences, University of Tennessee (Knoxville).

The project comprises of three sub research topics:
  - Data Scrapping project
  - Qualitative Resarch Project 

The Data Scrapping project was first begun while I was taking the Text Mining class at Haslam Business School. In this project I tried to study to what extent the scientific community adopt the Open Peer Review Publication Model. To understand this phonomena, specific URls were taken from OPR journal F1000 and specific HTML/CSS elements were extracted from the publication URLs. To run this code, perform the following steps:

  1. Start with installing Selector Gadget extension on your Chrome browser
  2. Install the package rvest on RStudio and run it
  
 Go on the particular URL and later click on Selector Gadget to see the HTML/CSS element you want to extract. After figuring out the element go ahead and put the element in the R code.
